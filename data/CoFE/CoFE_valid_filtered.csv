451,Stop supporting corrupt governments in migrant countries ,"The main reason for migration is poverty, and often times it is down to corruption in the leadership of poor countries. What people in such countries demand time and again is that the EU does not engage with their government, and do not supply financial support (which tends to end up in the wrong hands).

Soweit das nicht möglich ist, wird Integration folgendermassen sichergestellt: Die Anforderungen für Einbürgerungen werden massiv erhöht inkl. Gewissensprüfung und C2-Niveau bei einer Landessprache. Doppelte Staatsbürgerschaften Europa/Nicht-Europa sind verboten. Religiöse Symbole in der Öffentlichkeit werden verboten, Glaubensfreiheit gilt nur im Privatbereich.

• We need a truly common, European approach to migration and asylum, including a harmonization of the criteria, acceptance rates and conditions for asylum seekers.

• We call for a fair and centralised EU distribution system based on solidarity, that would allocate refugees between member states and would be coordinated by an enhanced agency in the place of the European Asylum Support office. For countries which are neglecting this distribution system, there should be a graduated sanction system.

• Financial support should be made available for refugee reception facilities within the European Union.

• European Union institutions should consider opening up the possibility of establishing centers to process asylum applications in the regions of origin, providing asylum seekers for alternatives to apply for asylum in the EU without the need to risk their lives physically traveling to the EU and thus reducing their risk of falling prey to human traffickers.

• There needs to be a proposal under EU law to better coordinate search and rescue (SAR) efforts in the Mediterranean, since Member states have to share their responsibility to support those efforts and host the people that have been rescued at sea.","Asylum and Migration:

Je veux juste vous rappeler que, nous devons essayer de mettre un terme à cette forme de séparation...L' Europe est capable d'accueillir tous ceux qui sont dans une situation délicate.

Les migrants font face partout à la stigmatisation, aux inégalités, à la xénophobie et au racisme.

As borders are closed, a large number of migrants are left to themselves, without income or home, away from their families and unable to return home, under the threat of an uncertain future. Solidarity with migrants has never been so necessary, considering the issue of immigration with compassion is more humane than the use of force. Indeed, we must control borders with humanity, fully respect human rights and the humanitarian needs of all.

Man kann doch verschiedene Bildungsprojekte und Aktionstage für die Bürger der EU auf die Beine stellen.

Auf jeden Fall kommen Belehrungen und das Behandeln mündiger Bürger wie kleine Kinder nicht gut an. Auf Augenhöhe miteinander kommunizieren und gegenseitig Achtung und Verständnis füreinander zeigen, das wird viel mehr bewirken. Da bin ich fest von überzeugt. .

10% aller globalen Treibhausgasemissionen gehen somit auf das Konto der Lebensmittelverschwendung.

Die EU hat dieses Problem bereits vor Jahren erkannt und den Aktionsplan für die Kreislaufwirtschaft und die EU-Strategie für ein nachhaltiges Lebensmittelsystem ins Leben gerufen. 

Maßnahmen zur Verringerung von Lebensmittelverlusten auf EU-Ebene sind aktuell das Einrichten einer Informationsplattform, das Einführen einer Überwachungs- und Berichterstattungspflicht, eine Ratsschlussfolgerung, die das Spenden unverkaufter Lebensmittel an Wohltätigkeitsorganisationen erleichtert, die Senkung der Mehrwertsteuersätze für gespendete Lebensmittel und die Verpflichtung zu Lebensmittelspenden ab einer bestimmten Größe.

Als Botschafterin des europaweit agierenden Lebensmittelrettungsnetzwerks ""Foodsharing"" bin ich mit diesen ersten Erfolgen zwar glücklich, weiß jedoch, dass noch viel mehr getan werden muss, um der Lebensmittelverschwendung wirkungsvoll entgegentreten zu können.

Daher schlage ich vor, die obenstehenden Maßnahmen um Folgendes zu erweitern:

- die EU-weite Vereinheitlichung von Datumsangaben auf Lebensmitteln 

- den Steuerverzicht auf gespendete Lebensmittel

- die Lebensmittelspendenverpflichtung unabhängig von der Menge

Measures to reduce food losses at EU level are currently the setting up of an information platform, the introduction of a monitoring and reporting obligation, a Council conclusion to facilitate the donation of unsold food to charities, the reduction of VAT rates for donated food and the obligation to donate food above a certain size. As ambassador of the Europe-wide food rescue network “Foodsharing”, I am happy with these first successes, but I know that much more needs to be done to effectively counter food waste.

120715,Accélérer l'innovation disruptive pour la transition énergétique ,"Lors de la COP21, les états ont pris des engagements forts pour le secteur de l’énergie: atteindre la neutralité carbone à 2050.

Pour ce faire, il y a une forte nécessité de développer très rapidement des technologies propres via des innovations de rupture: selon l’AIE, 50% de la baisse attendue des émissions en 2050 dépend des technologies qui sont encore au stade de prototype ou démonstrateur. 

Ci-après quelques mesures qui permettront le développement de l’innovation verte au sein de l’UE :

•	Créer un organisme européen d’excellence pour stimuler l’innovation de rupture pour la TE : selon le modèle de la DARPA, en combinant recherche fondamentale et start-ups pour développer des projets sur une durée courte

•	Cibler les financements  sur les technologies attendues pour générer de l’énergie verte: batteries électriques, H2 vert, capture et stockage de CO2  où l'UE est dépassé par d'autres pays

•	Faire connaître aux entreprises, en particulier PME, l’existence des différents fonds de financement européens et proposer des programmes de formation pour le dépôt des dossiers de financement

•	Mise en place d’une taxe carbone aux frontières de l’UE: pour éviter la « spécialisation » de certains pays dans les technologies polluantes et leur exportation dans les pays « vertueux »

•	Diffuser les technologies vertes vers les pays en développement: cela permet à ces pays, en pleine révolution industrielle polluante, de se réorienter vers les technologies vertes","At COP21, states made strong commitments for the energy sector: achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. To do this, there is a strong need to develop clean technologies very quickly through disruptive innovations: according to the IEA, 50 % of the expected drop in emissions in 2050 depends on technologies that are still in the prototype or demonstrator stage. Below are some measures that will enable the development of green innovation in the EU: • Create a European organisation of excellence to stimulate disruptive innovation for TE: according to the DARPA model, by combining basic research and start-ups to develop projects over a short period of time • Target funding on technologies expected to generate green energy: electric batteries, H2 green, CO2 capture and storage where the EU is overtaken by other countries • Making companies, in particular SMEs, aware of the existence of different European funding funds and propose training programmes for the submission of financing files • Implementing a carbon tax at the EU borders: to avoid the “specialisation” of some countries in polluting technologies and their export to “green” countries • Dissemination of green technologies to developing countries: this allows these countries, in the midst of a polluting industrial revolution, to shift to green technologies",Accelerating disruptive innovation for the energy transition,GreenDeal,fr,2,comment_117614,,Merci de cette information très intéressante Antonio!,0.0,comment_117614,True,0,0,fr,2021-10-15T13:41:57+02:00,In favor

232256,Ban of live-bait fishing within the EU,"We ask for the ban of live-bait fishing within the EU as well as the breeding, transport and commercialisation of fish used for live bait.

Live-bait fishing is used in both commercial and recreational fishing. It consists in using a live vertebrate animal as bait, most commonly a fish. The fisherman pierces its back or mouth with a hook and then casts it into the water in order to attract a carnivorous fish. The fish used as bait is kept impaled, alive and exposed to predators for several minutes or even several hours.

I would like the EU to embrace a bold new plus energy standard and make it available to all citizens who want it - no matter what income or education they have. Make sustainable living a human right. Build big homes out of sustainable materials for many households plus small business for everything you need, community nurses and other services like car & bike pools for cheap rental. Common working spaces and leisure spaces, child care etc. 

Apply every best practice 21st century solution available, like greening up facades to regulate temperature inside and outside, using compost toilet systems, which allows to handle manure and excréments easily without water or chemicals and use them for energy production etc. 

How to finance it? 

Maybe use a financial trick: Use social bonds to collect money, let investors organize the network of production for diverse modular elements including maschines for energy management. States together with the EU take the money from the bonds to pay the investors including a fee for their work. Then the buildings belong to the states and the Union. In the end inhabitants pay back investment & interests with their rents and own the whole thing as a community. 

It's just what comes to my mind. I'm not an expert. Maybe other people have better ideas, how to make it work.","Plus energy houses already exist in various sizes. They are mostly passive houses plus pv. But they are not part of any political program, not even of our thinking.

281986,Steuer auf Lärm,"In einem freiheitlichen Europa soll niemand gezwungen sein, seine Vorlieben für schnelle Autos, ""coole"" Motorräder oder andere, starke Geräusche verursachende Fahrzeuge zu unterdrücken.

Da jedoch Lärm - medizinisch anerkanntermaßen - ab einer gewissen Höhe und Ausprägung gesundheitsschädlich ist, sollte für alle Fahrzeuge eine am maximal entstehenden Geräusch (unter wohl definierten Bedingungen ähnlich NEFZ bzw. WLTP) orientiert, abgestufte, progressiv steigende  und jährlich zu entrichtende Steuer europaweit einheitlich festgelegt werden. 

Diese soll im EU-Haushalt verbucht und ausschließlich für Zwecke des Umweltschutzes verwendet werden.

Als nicht zu besteuerndes ""Referenzfahrzeug"" sollte ein synthetisch ermitteltes Modell aus dem Mittelwert der Geräuschentwicklung (in Dezibel) der fünf zulassungsstärksten e-Mobile (in der gesamten EU) jährlich neu festgelegt werden. 

Damit könnte als Ausgangsbasis der Besteuerung sichergestellt werden, dass einerseits sparsame und vernünftige Durchschnittsfahrzeuge nicht besteuert werden und andererseits technische Fortschritte, die zu weiterer Geräuschreduktion führen, automatisch mit berücksichtigt werden.

Da ein um 10 dezibel höherer Lärmpegel eine Verdoppelung des Lärms bedeutet, muss die Steuerprogression diesen Sachverhalt zwingend berücksichtigen! Erhoben werden könnte die Steuer im Rahmen der jeweiligen nationalen Kfz-Steuern als zusätzliche EU-Lärm-Abgabe - dies sollte keinen allzu hohen zusätzlichen Verwaltungsaufwand bedeuten.","In a liberal Europe, no one should be forced to suppress their preferences for fast cars, “cool” motorcycles or other vehicles causing heavy noise. However, since noise — medically recognised — is harmful to health from a certain level and form, a uniform Europe-wide tax should be set at the maximum noise generated (like NEDC or WLTP under well-defined conditions), graduated, progressively increasing and paying annually. This is to be entered in the EU budget and used exclusively for environmental protection purposes. As a non-taxable ‘reference vehicle’, a synthetically determined model should be redefined annually from the average noise (in decibels) of the five most registered e-mobiles (in the EU as a whole). As a starting point for taxation, this could ensure that, on the one hand, economical and reasonable average vehicles are not taxed and, on the other hand, technical progress leading to further noise reduction is automatically taken into account. Since a 10 decibel higher noise level means a doubling of the noise, tax progression must take this matter into account! The tax could be collected as an additional EU noise tax within the framework of the respective national car taxes — this should not entail too much additional administrative burden.",Tax on noise,GreenDeal,de,0,comment_244498,,"Negative externalities, like noise pollution, should be taxed.

Wheat is, as far as I know, the least nutricous crop which we have. It's genetically quite complex, very vulnerable & has been chosen & developed only because of high yields. But with regenerative practices we can grow highly diverse high quality crops & have high yields per hectare. 
Regenerative agriculture also regenerates the landscape, water cycles, water quality, ground water supply & biodiversity. It sequesters carbon & so helps reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. If combined with traits of agroforestry, it also can supply parts of the timber we might need.

65606,Lutte contre le réchauffement climatique : la mise en place de compte carbone individuel au niveau européen,"Depuis 1992, la lutte contre le réchauffement climatique a été  inefficace. L’empreinte carbone des Européens ne s’est pas réduite : les progrès apparents sur le sol européen résultent de la délocalisation des activités industrielles les plus consommatrices en énergie. Taxation du prix du carbone et multiplication des normes (comme le Pacte Vert), se sont avérées inefficaces; socialement injustes elles sont rejetées par la population. Un changement complet de perspective s’impose.

En France, les Assises du climat tenues début 2021 (www.assisesduclimat.fr)  ont posé le problème dans des termes très différents : s’imposer une obligation de résultat conforme à nos engagements internationaux,  en réduisant de 6 % par an notre empreinte, de 10t à 2t en trente ans. Cela signifie que les émissions sont rationnées et que le plafond s’abaisse de 6 % par an. Quatre critères permettent de comparer et évaluer les différentes politiques possibles : prendre en compte la totalité de l’empreinte écologique; garantir que le résultat sera atteint ; assurer la justice sociale ; mobiliser tous les acteurs privés et publics au service des objectifs communs.

 Une seule politique respecte ces quatre critères : l’allocation à chaque citoyen d’un quota individuel d’émission librement négociable, un compte carbone (www.comptecarbone.org). Ce sont ces perspectives dont on a besoin au plan européen: en organisant des Assises européennes du climat; en définissant le compte carbone pays par pays","Since 1992, the fight against global warming has been ineffective. The carbon footprint of Europeans has not been reduced: the apparent progress on European soil is the result of the relocation of the most energy-intensive industrial activities. Taxation of carbon prices and multiplication of standards (such as the Green Pact) have proved to be ineffective; socially unfair they are rejected by the population. A complete change of perspective is needed. In France, the Climate Assises held in early 2021 (www.assisesduclimat.fr) posed the problem in very different terms: impose a performance obligation in line with our international commitments, reducing our footprint by 6 % per year, from 10 t to 2 t in thirty years. This means that emissions are rationed and the ceiling lowers by 6 % per year. Four criteria make it possible to compare and evaluate the different possible policies: take into account the entire ecological footprint; ensure that the result will be achieved; ensuring social justice; mobilising all private and public actors in the pursuit of common objectives. Only one policy meets these four criteria: the allocation to each citizen of an individual emission allowance freely negotiable, a carbon account (www.comptecarbone.org).

Ražu purvos var sākt gaidīt pēc 5 gadiem.Tāpēc šis ir tipisks ilgtermiņa ieguldījums, kuru zemnieks nevar atļauties šodienas krīzes situācijā.

-Exportstopp von Müll, um die Industrie zu zwingen, die in der EU vorhandenen Technologien zum Recycling zu nutzen und nicht das Problem auf andere Länder zu verlagern (Verursacherprinzip)

- Standartisierung von Verpackungsmaterial zur einfacheren Wiederverwertung

- Grundprinzip der Verpackungsvermeidung einführen und nur auf das Notwendige reduzieren (Hygiene, Transportsicherung, Plastikvermeidung etc.)

- Gesetzliche Vorgaben zur deutlichen Reduzierung der thermischen Verwertung von Plastikabfällen, um die Rohstoffe möglichst sortenrein wiederzuverwerten

- Verbot von Mikroplastik in Produkten des täglichen Bedarfs/ Alternativ: Beteiligung der produzierenden Firmen an den Kosten einer wirksamen EU-weiten Abwasserreinigung

- Beteiligung der EU an der Beseitigung der Abfallwirbel in den Ozeanen, die auch infolge des Abfallexportes aus Europa gespeist werden.

Begründung

Die Technologien zur Wiederverwertung von Verpackungsabfällen sind in der EU vorhanden. Es ist derzeitig billiger, den Müll zu exportieren und andere Länder zu belasten, die wiederum ihre Umwelt meist verschmutzen, da sie die hohen Standards der EU bezüglich Umweltschutz nicht einhalten müssen. Auch wird der Verbrennung Vorrang vor der Wiederverwertung gegeben, was eine Verschwendung von Rohstoffen mit CO2 Emissionen darstellt. Mikroplastik kann derzeitig nicht mit vertretbarem Aufwand zurück gehalten werden","In order to address the waste problem in the EU, the following measures should be taken: —Stop exports of waste in order to force industry to use existing technologies in the EU for recycling and not to shift the problem to other countries (polluter pays principle) – Standardisation of packaging material for easier recycling – introduce a basic principle of packaging prevention and reduce it only to what is necessary (hygienics, transport security, plastic avoidance, etc.) – Legal requirements to significantly reduce the thermal recovery of plastic waste in order to recycle raw materials in the best possible way – Prohibition of microplastics in everyday products/alternative: Participation of producing companies in the cost of effective EU-wide wastewater treatment – EU involvement in the disposal of waste hurdles in the oceans, which are also fed as a result of the export of waste from Europe. Justification The technologies for recycling packaging waste are available in the EU. It is currently cheaper to export waste and pollute other countries, which in turn mostly pollute their environment, as they do not have to comply with the EU’s high environmental standards.

Das hat mehrere negative Effekte. Beispielsweise zerstören billige (weil durch die Gemeinsame Agrarpolitik [GAP] subventionierte) Lebensmittel lokale Lebensmittelmärkte in Ländern des Globalen Südens. Daneben sind auch die Umwelteffekte einer stärker intensivierten Landwirtschaft, die weit über dem Bedarf der europäischen Bevölkerung wirtschaftet, enorm – Überdüngung, Bodendegradierung, Eutrophierung, Tierleid, etc... 

Daher möge sich die EU im Rahmen des Green Deals und ihrer Neuorientierung dafür einsetzen, die europäische Landwirtschaft wieder stärker auf die Bedürfnisse und den Konsum der Europäischen Bevölkerung auszurichten. Das soll sie erreichen, indem sie Exportbarrieren oder EU-weite Versorgungs-Quoten für Lebensmittel wie Milch, Fleisch oder Getreide einführt. 

Das soll nicht heißen, dass Handel mit landwirtschaftlichen Gütern verboten werden soll, allerdings müssen wir Teile der Liberalisierung der Agrarwirtschaft zurückfahren, auch im Interesse der Landwirtschaft, die dann nicht mehr mit der ganzen Welt konkurrieren muss. Wir brauchen kürzere, lokalere Versorgungswege und eine Ernährungswende!","The EU’s agriculture is now to a large extent designed to produce goods for the world. This has several negative effects. For example, cheap food (because it is subsidised by the Common Agricultural Policy [CAP]) destroys local food markets in countries of the Global South. In addition, the environmental effects of a more intensive agriculture, which manages well beyond the needs of the European population, are enormous — overfertilisation, soil degradation, eutrophication, animal suffering, etc... Therefore, in the context of the Green Deal and its reorientation, the EU is committed to refocusing European agriculture on the needs and consumption of the European population. This is achieved by introducing export barriers or EU-wide supply quotas for food such as milk, meat or cereals. This does not mean that trade in agricultural goods is to be prohibited, but we must reduce parts of the liberalisation of agriculture, also in the interests of agriculture, which will then no longer have to compete with the whole world.

So on a clock running by it, it is 12 pm when the sun is at its peak, every day of the year. In Greenwich and in Prague, for instance, the current local time in winter is in line with astronomical time - but in these places this is not the case in summer (where the clock is made to run an hour ahead of the sun's orbit) and it is never the case in all the other places that are not located on the same degree of latitude. ---

Création d’une Haute Autorité Sanitaire Européenne (HASE) s’inspirant de la CECA

Face à la crise sanitaire, l’Union européenne a la capacité, inscrite dans ses traités, de créer de nouvelles structures permettant de mieux se préparer collectivement. Ainsi, la HASE s’intègrerait

-	dans les  « réalisations concrètes » et immédiates pour le bien commun européen 

-	dans les financements existants (volet santé de Horizon Europe, fonds de cohésion, facilité pour la reprise et la résilience)

-	dans la nécessité politique de délimiter des domaines stratégiques affectant l’Union  tout en donnant des définitions claires des engagements et des responsabilités de chacun. Rechercher la répartition des tâches la plus efficace est le meilleur moyen de trouver un équilibre entre la nécessité de l’urgence et un fonctionnement démocratique.

Cette Haute Autorité devra assurer une veille et une politique de prévention des crises sanitaires. En cas de crise avérée et dans des cas spécifiques, elle pourrait activer, de sa seule initiative, un dispositif intégré, assorti de modalités et de moyens prédéfinis.

Le texte d’orientation pourrait s’inspirer des dispositifs de la CECA. En cas d’absence  d’accord unanime, il pourra s’agir d’une coopération renforcée.

Enfin, dans l’intérêt bien compris des Européens et dans leur tradition de défense des droits de l’homme, il faudra également réfléchir aux moyens de faire profiter des pays hors de l’Union européenne de ces structures","First proposal Creation of a European High Health Authority (HASE) inspired by the ECSC In response to the health crisis, the European Union has the capacity, enshrined in its Treaties, to create new structures to better prepare itself collectively. Thus, HASE would be integrated — in the “concrete and immediate achievements” for the European common good — into existing funding (Health strand of Horizon Europe, Cohesion Fund, Recovery and Resilience Facility) — in the political need to delineate policy areas affecting the Union while providing clear definitions of each other’s commitments and responsibilities. Finding the most effective division of labour is the best way to balance the need for urgency and democratic functioning. This High Authority will have to ensure a monitoring and policy for the prevention of health crises. In the event of a proven crisis and in specific cases, it could activate, on its own initiative, an integrated system, with predefined modalities and means. The guidance text could be inspired by the ECSC’s provisions. If there is no unanimous agreement, this may be enhanced cooperation.

252682,Autoimmunity and mesh for hernia repair,"There are about 20 milion meshes implanted world wide.

And some people believe that their autoimmunity was triggered by their mesh. And demand to have it explanted. Many have completely different issues regarding their repair and they surely need the mesh out. Some do not  have autoimmunity at all and many get worse after the explantation. 

This is because nobody really knows what to do. There are no pathways set up and pople just demand something which some surgeons then just do. But these are often not specialists or are ""self-called"" specialists, patients believe lots of misinformation that is on the internet and there are too many other factors that play a role in this. 

The most common triggors of autoimmunity are smoking, obesity and stress. Many of these patients are obese, smoke and are under a lot of stress, yet blame their mesh. 

There is also a lot known that autoimmunity depends largely on genetic predisposition. And in those with wrong genetic information anything will trigger it. even meshless operation!

We need proper attention to this issue, stop making it tabu, allow it to grom grey economy and have opened scientific discussion how to investigate these people properly and how to treat them.","There are about 20 milion meshes implanted world wide.

Umgang mit eigenen Sorgen und Ängsten und denen der Kinder, oder Selbstvertrauen bei Kindern und Eltern stärken).

It would also make it easier to protect children from violence, for example by overwhelming them, or to recognise them in the home and to learn from the outset how to take care of their mental health.

The paper, published on April 30, 2021, in Circulation Research, also shows conclusively that COVID-19 is a vascular disease, demonstrating exactly how the SARS-CoV-2 virus damages and attacks the vascular system on a cellular level. The findings help explain COVID-19's wide variety of seemingly unconnected complications, and could open the door for new research into more effective therapies.
I look forward to the discovery of yet unexplored Natural Capacities, for example, exploring 136 cranberry clones from different forests in Canada.

They can not go to school due to the pandemic, their social contact is reduced immensely and they are facing a housing and a climate crisis. As read in the report of EU-Compass for Action on Mental Health and Well-being mental health facilities are not equal in all of Europe. That is why I propose an online mental health tool kit which explains what small changes you can make your self to improve your mental health, how to signal mental health problems in others and how to help them/get people to talk about it. This toolkit would provide a base level of community support and would certainly not replace professional help. This toolkit would focus on different mental problems, not just depression. 

In addition sharing and translating educational material from countries that have taken up mental health as a part of their school curricula would also be available in this toolkit. This could provide community driven organisations such as The international federation of medical students association (IFMSA) and driven teachers with a basis to build their own educational tools to further expand on. Doing so would vastly decrease the barrier to start a mental health advocacy organisation or help those dear to you.

Promotion of this toolkit should be done on the channels of national and European governmental organisations and social media. This toolkit should ofcourse be freely available at no cost.","The mental health of young Europeans is under immense pressure.

Die Veranlagung über die Kapitalmärkte wird auf Grund der Demografie in der Altersvorsorge (2. und 3. Säule) noch wichtiger werden. Gleichzeitig muss die Kreditfinanzierung als wichtigste externe Finanzierungsform der KMU gesichert werden, die vielfältige Bankenstruktur in Europa muss bewahrt werden.

Nach der Krise wird der Aufbau von Eigenkapital ein wichtiges Thema sein. Der Review von Solvency II und die finale Basel III+-Umsetzung müssen sicherstellen, dass EU-Banken und -Versicherungen weiterhin Unternehmen mit Eigenkapital versorgen können. Für die Reform des Basel III-Regelwerks regen wir die Schaffung eines Sustainability Supporting Factors an, bei gleichzeitiger Vermeidung höherer Kreditkosten für Unternehmen, für deren Kredite der Faktor nicht anwendbar ist. Der KMU-Unterstützungsfaktor muss jedenfalls beibehalten werden. Das Regelwerk zu den Verbriefungen sollte sinnvoll angepasst werden (Erleichterung von synthetischen Verbriefungen, Anpassung des prudentiellen Rahmens).

For the reform of the Basel III framework, we propose the creation of a Sustainability Supporting Factor, while avoiding higher credit costs for companies for whose loans the factor is not applicable. In any case, the SME support factor must be maintained. The rules on securitisation should be adapted appropriately (facilitation of synthetic securitisation, adjustment of the prudential framework).

Les crises économiques récentes ont creusé les inégalités entre les États membres  et en leur au sein. Les citoyens de l'UE bénéficient de niveaux de protection contre les chocs économiques et la pauvreté à long terme différents selon l’État où ils vivent, car la politique sociale reste principalement une compétence nationale.

Tout en respectant le principe de subsidiarité, pour réduire la pauvreté et les inégalités, l'UE doit élaborer un cadre juridique garantissant des normes sociales minimales, notamment des conditions de vie et de travail décentes et une protection sociale adéquate. Le droit du travail doit être harmonisé dans toute l'UE, selon le principe « un même salaire pour le même travail au même endroit ». Le salaire minimum dans l'UE doit correspondre à un vrai salaire de subsistance, tandis qu'un système européen permanent de réassurance chômage doit être instauré. L’application de ces normes doit être vérifiée au niveau européen et soutenue par une fiscalité européenne indépendante des contributions nationales au budget de l'Union. Garante des normes sociales minimales, l'UE aurait une vraie valeur ajoutée, chaque État membre étant libre d'offrir des garanties sociales supérieures à cette protection minimale.","Despite the overall wealth of the EU, one tenth of Europeans are affected by absolute poverty, preventing them from meeting their basic needs, and a quarter by relative poverty, giving them access only to the bulk. Recent economic crises have widened inequalities between and within Member States. EU citizens enjoy different levels of protection against economic shocks and long-term poverty depending on the state in which they live, as social policy remains primarily a national competence. While respecting the principle of subsidiarity, in order to reduce poverty and inequality, the EU needs to develop a legal framework guaranteeing minimum social standards, including decent living and working conditions and adequate social protection. Labour law must be harmonised across the EU, according to the principle of “the same wage for the same work in the same place”. The minimum wage in the EU must correspond to a real subsistence wage, while a permanent European system of unemployment reinsurance must be introduced. The application of these standards must be verified at European level and supported by European taxation independent of national contributions to the Union budget.

201466,Renta básica europea,"Mi idea se centra en la creación de una renta básica o mínima para todos los ciudadanos de la Unión, semejante a la que ya han implementado algunos Estados Miembros, teniendo como objetivo fundamental luchar contra la desigualdad social. 

Desde la creación de la Unión, se han implementado avances de diversa índole como la libre circulación de trabajadores, mercado interior común o creación de la ciudadanía europea. Creo que es de suma importancia la adopción de ésta renta básica, que sustituiría a la actual de algunos Estados Miembros (si es que la tienen) y sería común para todos los ciudadanos europeos. 

En relación a cómo podría sufragarse, una opción podría ser la armonización fiscal de la Unión, es decir, que todas las empresas y personas paguen los mismos impuestos sin importar el Estado al que pertenezcan. Así además se eliminarían  los paraísos fiscales, una de las principales fuentes de desigualdad entre los estados miembros de la Unión. 

Creo necesaria que todos los ciudadanos de la Unión cuenten con una renta mensual que les permita desarrollar sus necesidades básicas, sin importar las circunstancias económicas o sociales en las que se encuentren. Sería un importante paso en la consecución de la equidad e igualdad entre los ciudadanos europeos y el refuerzo de los derechos humanos, así como especifica el artículo 1 de la Carta Fundamental De los Derechos Humanos de la Unión “Todos los ciudadanos tienen derecho a la dignidad humana”","My idea is to create a basic or minimum income for all citizens of the Union, similar to that already implemented by some Member States, with the fundamental objective of combating social inequality.

I think it is of the utmost importance to adopt this basic income, which would replace the current one in some Member States (if they do) and would be common to all European citizens. As regards how it could be financed, one option could be EU tax harmonisation, i.e. all companies and individuals pay the same taxes regardless of the State to which they belong. This would also eliminate tax havens, one of the main sources of inequality between EU member states. I believe it is necessary for all citizens of the Union to have a monthly income to enable them to develop their basic needs, regardless of the economic or social circumstances in which they may find themselves.

10206,Förenkla resandet med en gemensam plattform för bokning inom hela Europa,"Om jag idag vill åka tåg från Stockholm, Sverige till Hannover, Tyskland så är jag tvungen att kolla upp varifrån jag kan åka, vilka tågbolag som kör sträckan och betala till flera olika företag på flera olika plattformar i olika valutor för biljetterna. Dessutom är det svårt att veta vilka alternativ det finns eftersom plattformen jag kollar på just nu endast visar de resor de vill sälja. Kanske är det billigare med buss, kanske snabbare med flyget, kanske finns det en kortare tågsträcka osv

Därför föreslår jag att EU skapar en plattform (app) där man som EU-medborgare enkelt kan boka biljetter till sin resa. Ovasätt i vilket land, stad eller ort du befinner dig i. Ovasätt om du vill åka tåg, buss, taxi, båt eller flyg så ska alla biljetter för resande inom EU kunna bokas och betalas via en endaste plattform. 

Det ska räcka med att knappar in adressen man vill åka från och vilken adress man vill åka till så ska man få upp alternativ som visar vad som är billigast,  går snabbast och är bäst för miljö etc. 

Det bör vara lagkrav att alla företag som sysslar med resor inom EU ska vara anslutna. Även om de självklart kan fortsätta ha sina egna bokningsplattformar om de vill.

Detta skulle förenkla resandet inom Europa och öka resandet. Vilket i sin tur leder till starkare ekonomi.","If I want today to travel trains from Stockholm, Sweden to Hannover, Germany, I have to check where I can travel, which train companies are driving the route and pay to several different companies on several different platforms in different currencies for tickets. In addition, it is difficult to know what alternatives are available because the platform I am checking at the moment only shows the trips they want to sell. Perhaps it is cheaper by bus, perhaps faster by air, perhaps there may be a shorter train path, etc. Therefore, I suggest that the EU create a platform (app) where EU citizens can easily book tickets for their journey. If you want to travel by rail, bus, taxi, boat or air, all tickets for intra-EU travellers can be booked and paid through a single platform. It should be enough to check in the address you want to go from and to which address you want to go to, find options that show what is cheapest, which are the fastest and which are best for the environment, etc. It should be a legal requirement for all companies involved in intra-EU travel to be connected. Although, of course, they can continue to have their own booking platforms if they wish to do so. This would simplify travel within Europe and increase travel.

DER VORSCHLAG – Damit die Wirtschaft nicht länger nur den Intentionen gewinnorientierter Anleger und Investoren ausgeliefert bleibt, soll aus dem System der Europäischen Zentralbanken eine profitunabhängige, permanente Finanzierung für Unternehmen geschaffen werden. Wenn sie in kooperativen Zusammenschlüssen nachhaltig und zukunftsorientiert für den Bedarf der Menschen tätig sind und dabei zugleich die Lebenssphäre der Natur schützen, erhalten sie fortlaufend zinsfreie Kredite. Dafür verpflichten sie sich, vergleichbare Einkommen wie in öffentlichen Einrichtungen zu zahlen und mit den Gewinnen dem Gemeinwohl zu dienen. Dadurch wird auch solchen Unternehmen, die gesellschaftsrelevante Aufgaben erfüllen, aber die erhaltenen Kredite nicht aus eigenen Einnahmen ablösen können oder sollen, solidarisch die Kredit-Rückzahlung ermöglicht. Dazu hat die „European Credit Initiative“ einen konkreten, juristisch geprüften Gesetzesvorschlag zur Ergänzung der Satzung der Europäischen Zentralbank  (Artikel 18.1) ausgearbeitet: 

Unternehmen und Banken sowie deren kooperativen Zusammenschlüssen soll eine freie Finanzierung durch zinsfreie Kredite eröffnet werden, wenn sie dauerhaft auf Profit verzichten, Gewinne dem Gemeinwohl gewidmet und die Einkommen der Mitarbeiter öffentlichem Recht unterstellt werden.","As a way out of the current crises, we need a new type of economy — environmentally and socially future-proof. A global challenge where Europe can lead the way. The PROPOSAL — to ensure that the economy is no longer confined to the intentions of profit-driven investors and investors, the European Central Bank system should provide non-profit-making, permanent financing for companies. If they operate in cooperative groupings in a sustainable and future-oriented manner for people’s needs while protecting nature’s sphere of life, they continue to receive interest-free loans. To that end, they undertake to pay comparable income as in public institutions and to serve the public interest with the profits. This will also allow those companies that carry out socially relevant tasks but cannot or should not replace the loans received from their own revenues to repay loans in a spirit of solidarity. To this end, the European Credit Initiative has prepared a specific, legally examined legislative proposal to supplement the Statute of the European Central Bank (Article 18.1): Companies and banks, as well as their cooperative associations, should be provided with free financing by means of interest-free loans, provided that they permanently forgo profit, that profits are allocated to the public good and that the income of employees under public law is imputed.",Financing a sustainable economy,Economy,de,17,comment_1196,,"Das finde ich gut.

584,Massnahmen zur Vermeidung von Steuervermeidungsstrategien und -flucht von Grossunternehmen,"Seit Jahren hat die EU ein Problem mit sogannenten Steuerflucht & ""Steuervermeidungsstrategien"" von Unternehmen, die in Europa grosse Gewinne erzielen. Hier haben sich auch einige Mitgliedsländer bisher nicht mit Rum bekleckert, da diese besondere Sonderstellungen gewähren (z.B. Irland und die Niederlande). Damit hier eine nachhaltige gute Lösung gefunden werden kann, muss dies über das derzeit besprochene ""Public country-by-country reporting"" hinausgehen (reiner Ausweis von Gewinn und Steuern je Land). Ein Lösungsansatz wäre, dass genauso wie bei der Mehrwertsteuer, am Ende auch der Gewinn dort versteuert werden muss, wo die Umsätze generiert wurden. Somit ist es egal wo das HQ des Unternehmens platziert wird und man muss eben prozentual dort seine Gewinne besteuern, wo sie erzielt wurden. Das Totschlagargument der Kritiker war bisher immer, dass Unternehmen, dann ihre Dienstleistungen / Produkte, dort dann nicht mehr anbieten würden. Dies ist aber ein klarer Trugschluss. Laut VWL 1.0 wird so lange ein Produkt/Dienstleistung betrieben, solang es wirtschaftlich ist. Da die Besteuerung nur auf den Gewinn angewendet wird, ist der Grenznutzen trotzdem weiterhin positiv. Der einzige Unterschied ist, dass die Steuern fairer bezahlt werden und in die Wirtschaftskreisläufe fliessen, wo die Käufe auch getätigt wurden. Diese Strategie würde dazu führen, dass sich die Staaten nicht mehr gegenseitig unterbieten müssen und die Unternehmen ihrer Verantwortung gerecht werden.","For years, the EU has had a problem with tax evasion and “tax avoidance strategies” of companies making big profits in Europe. Some Member States have so far not been embarrassed with rum, as they grant special special positions (e.g. Ireland and the Netherlands). In order for a sustainable good solution to be found, this must go beyond the “public country-by-country reporting” currently discussed (purely showing profit and taxes per country). A solution would be that, in the same way as VAT, profit must be taxed where the transactions were generated. So it doesn't matter where the company’s HQ is placed and you have to tax your profits in percentages where they were made. The critics’ homicide argument has always been that companies, then their services/products, would no longer offer there. But this is a clear fallacy. According to VWL 1.0, a product/service is operated as long as it is economical. As taxation is applied only to profit, the marginal benefit remains positive. The only difference is that the taxes are paid more fairly and flow into the economic cycles, where the purchases were made. This strategy would mean that states will no longer have to undercut each other and companies will assume their responsibilities.",Measures to avoid tax avoidance policies and evasion of large companies,Economy,de,17,comment_7530,,"Konzerne wie Amazon machen offiziell nur Verluste in der EU, da sie z.B. wahnsinnig hohe Lizensgebühren für irgendeinen Mist an eine ""Firma"" in einem Steuerparadies ""bezahlen"" müssen.

A seguito dell’emergenza pandemica dovuta al covid19, infatti, sono sorte delle lacune soprattutto in ambito sanitario, un'area comune nella quale potrebbero concentrarsi delle risorse europee. Infatti, nelle strutture 

sanitarie di tutta l’Europa sono emerse mancanze materiali. Allo stesso modo nell’ambito dell’istruzione, gli studenti hanno dovuto far ricorso ai propri mezzi per affrontare quella che poi si è rivelata una crisi culturale. Una tassazione comune potrebbe essere il mezzo più adatto per far fronte alle necessità appena descritte,

avremmo una base più solida per intervenire nelle crisi che potrebbero sorgere. Per attuare tale riforma sarebbe necessaria una figura con requisiti tecnici, un ministro delle finanze. I contributi che l’Unione ha investito nella realizzazione delle pari opportunità e lotta alla discriminazione crediamo che non abbiano raggiunto i 

traguardi desiderati, soprattutto i governi dei paesi che pur essendo membri, si ostinano a portare avanti una visione conservatrice, in contrasto con i diritti umani e soprattutto i valori promossi dall’Unione e la maggior parte dei suoi cittadini.

Sztuczna inteligencja i uczenie maszynowe stały się dla producentów popularnymi narzędziami służącymi do poprawy wydajności i optymalizacji zużycia energii. Jednym z pomysłów w ramach współfinansowanego ze środków UE projektu FUDIPO (https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/723523)  poczyniono ogromne postępy w zakresie wykorzystania sztucznej inteligencji w kilku najważniejszych sektorach przemysłu przetwórczego w celu osiągnięcia radykalnej poprawy efektywności energetycznej i efektywnego gospodarowania zasobami. Celem jest ograniczenie przestojów, fluktuacji, korozji, zanieczyszczeń oraz nagromadzeń umożliwia rozwój algorytmów sterowania w celu poprawy wydajności i pomiaru jakości napływających odpadów, zmniejszając tym samym zapotrzebowanie na napowietrzanie w celu oszczędzania energii. Innym z możliwych zastosowań sztucznej inteligencji w sektorze energetycznym jest możliwość przewidywania zapotrzebowania na energię elektryczną, zarówno w perspektywie długo- jak i krótkoterminowej, co ma znaczenie dla produkcji energii i jej sprzedaży. Sztuczna inteligencja może zostać również wykorzystana do przewidywania pogody, a w szczególności siły wiatru i natężenia słonecznego, co jest szczególnie ważne przy planowaniu systemów energetycznych opartych na odnawialnych źródłach energii.","The importance of machine learning in improving the quality of the production process is increasingly recognised.

The aim is to reduce downtime, fluctuations, corrosion, pollution and accumulation allows the development of control algorithms to improve efficiency and measure the quality of incoming waste, thereby reducing the need for aeration to save energy. Another possible application of AI in the energy sector is the ability to anticipate electricity demand, both in the long and short term, which is important for energy production and sales.

Lokale Unternehmen haben zwar keine große Reichweite bzw. Markenauftritt, damit könnten sie aber Kunden in anderen EU-Staaten oder Regionen gewinnen. Die Plattform sollte eine Hierarchie haben, um nach Regionen in der EU sortieren zu können, z.B. Suche in Region Frankreich: Lothringen, danach sortiere nach Art der Güter z.B. Geschenke, Bücher etc. Es darf kein Algorithmus sein, der nur den besten Preis nach vorne bringt. Die KMUs müssten echte Schaufenster bekommen, so dass der Kunde online flanieren kann. Mit Weiterentwicklung von virtueller Technik (augmented reality) sind in Zukunft vielleicht sogar Stadtbummel in einem beliebigen europäischen Ziel möglich. Da die KMUs vom persönlichen Kontakt leben, sollte auch eine direkte Kontaktaufnahme möglich sein gegebenenfalls mit Videoberatungen.

Although local companies do not have a wide reach or brand, they could attract customers in other EU countries or regions. The platform should have a hierarchy in order to be able to sort by region in the EU, e.g. search in the region of France: Lorraine, then sort according to the type of goods, e.g. gifts, books, etc. It must not be an algorithm that only leads the best price. SMEs would need to have real shop windows so that the customer can flank online. With the further development of virtual technology (augmented reality), it may even be possible in the future to have city bumbs in any European destination.

To scale up both EU’s integration and resilience, there are at least two policies in the financial sector that should be implemented with the utmost urgency.

First, it is necessary to reinforce the ECB’s mandate. The legal complaints that challenged the validity of its asset purchase programs have clearly shown that a more hypertrophic role of the ECB is not widely accepted within the EU yet. However, in the aftermath of the 2007-2008 financial crisis first, and, more recently, in the middle of the Covid pandemic, the ECB’s policies have clearly contributed to a more resilient EU. With climate-related financial risks and other pressing large-scale social issues on the horizon, we cannot afford a weak ECB.

Second, the EU should urgently assess whether and to what extent climate-related financial risk can be a source of macroeconomic imbalances. Some work in this direction has begun, but the EU needs to conduct the assessment rapidly and, if necessary, to design policies that limit the gradual build-up of such risks in the financial system. In doing so, it is crucial to also conduct appropriate economic analysis to investigate whether policies in this direction can potentially backfire in the short-term (by, e.g., creating imbalances in banks’ balance sheets that could, ironically, go at the expense of financial stability itself).

Save a lot of space, reduce ecological footprint, save a lot of money.

Some of the money will be needed to subsidize, in compensation, more croplands etc. but since eating plants directly (instead of via animals) is much more efficient there still will be a lot of money left for better use:

Use those billions to fix the environment and social issues: help small farmers, reduce poverty, create welfare housing, improve health care, improve education...

Invest in infrastructure and research. Alleviate the economic effects of Covid19. Reduce VAT. Etc.

The EU needs to SERIOUSLY Reform the Common Agricultural Policy!

24190,European minimal corporate tax,"Finally a global agreement on corporate tax might come into existence thanks to Joe Biden's administration.

Unfortunately it appears that the European-Union (EU) remains unable to take courageous decisions and that we still have to wait for a move from the US to adopt ground-breaking solutions.

A shame considering that it's already been known for many years that the EU is the home of the tax havens that are the Netherlands, Ireland, Malta and Luxembourg. 

These countries specialized their economies into the redirection of wealth created in their European « partners » and actively participated in the race to the bottom in terms of fiscality within the EU.

Instead of stopping this evaporation of tax revenues, the governments of the EU decided to implement harsh austerity measures targeting health systems, education, the police, the defense and scientific research.

This builded-up into systemic weaknesses that were only partly revealed during the Covid pandemic.

These poor political choices also led to social unrests and the endangerment of the EU through a loss of faith in the European project.

The US proposal for a global corporate tax was originally 21%, and lowered to 15% under the pressure from European tax havens including Ireland.

I propose to bring back a bit of boldness into EU politics by :

- Enforcing a corporate tax of 25% within the entire Union.

Österreich ist wirtschaftlich eng mit allen Beitrittskandidaten des Westbalkans verbunden und zählt zu den größten Investoren in der Region. In Bosnien-Herzegowina belegt Österreich sogar Platz 1 und in Serbien und Nordmazedonien den 2. Platz. Die Förderung der Entwicklung Südosteuropas zu einem Raum der Stabilität, Demokratie und Rechtsstaatlichkeit ist daher für die österreichische Wirtschaft wesentlich.

Von größter Bedeutung ist eine glaubwürdige Erweiterungsstrategie. Es ist daher einerseits wichtig, dass der EU-Rat den Verhandlungsrahmen mit Albanien und Nordmazedonien so schnell wie möglich annimmt und die ersten Regierungskonferenzen abhält und andererseits auch die Verhandlungen mit Serbien und Montenegro beschleunigt. Bilaterale Konflikte sind vor einem Beitritt zu lösen. 

Die EU ist der wichtigste Handels- und Investitionspartner aller Beitrittskandidaten und – trotz wachsendem Einfluss anderer Länder wie China und Russland – nach wie vor der größte finanzielle Unterstützer, zuletzt durch den Wirtschafts- und Investitionsplan für den Westbalkan. Dies sollte viel stärker kommuniziert werden, denn sonst besteht die Gefahr einer stärkeren Einflussnahme Russlands und Chinas am Westbalkan und dass sich die Region von der EU und der Demokratieentwicklung nach dem EU-Vorbild entfernt.","The prospects of EU accession are a driving force for economic reform and strengthening the rule of law in countries seeking EU membership. Austria is economically closely linked to all the candidate countries of the Western Balkans and is one of the largest investors in the region.

Promoting the development of south-eastern Europe into an area of stability, democracy and the rule of law is therefore essential for the Austrian economy. A credible enlargement strategy is of the utmost importance. It is therefore important, on the one hand, that the EU Council adopts the negotiating framework with Albania and Northern Macedonia as soon as possible and holds the first intergovernmental conferences and, on the other hand, accelerates negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro. Bilateral conflicts must be resolved before accession. The EU is the most important trading and investment partner of all candidate countries and – despite the growing influence of other countries such as China and Russia – still the largest financial supporter, most recently through the economic and investment plan for the Western Balkans.

If the EU wants to be recognised on the international stage as a world player, it has to develop its CFSP decision making capabilities, it has to speak with one voice, it has to have a stick. 

The key to an effective CFSP is stepping away from unanimous decisions and proposing an ambitious multiphase membership within a CFSP action scheme. 

CFSP Action Scheme

Action I, Majority: Diplomatic sanctions / Economic sanctions

Action II, Qualified majority: Embargo (military enforced) / Peace keeping force /         Air strikes

Action III, Unanimity: Limited military operations involving ground troops / Full scale military action

Within this scheme we identify three “actions” according to the casualty/political risk involved. Action I, low risk; Action II, medium risk; Action III, medium to high risk.

In case some member states are reluctant to adhere to the CFSP action scheme as a whole, countries could adhere to “Action I”; while others to “Action I & II”.

The CFSP would in effect be a reactive, ad hoc policy instead of a pro-active one. The action scheme would be triggered by a at least four member states demanding a summit.","Current CFSP is often characterised by internal disagreements, pumped declarations and immobilism.

2103,An EU United Nations Security Council Seat,"The European Union should gain a seat at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to better advance its interests in the world and reinforce international human rights protection, peace and security and the multilateral order.

For years, efforts at reform of the UNSC have centred around expanding the number of permanent seats to countries such as Germany, Japan, India, Brazil and two African countries.

The EU has permanent observer status at the UN without voting rights; but has had a central role in coordinating its member state delegations. Due to an increasingly unstable international climate where multilateralism and the rules-based international order are under threat, the EU should have a seat at the table of global security management in line with its quest for more strategic autonomy.

Such a UNSC seat for the EU should go hand in hand with a comprehensive reform of the UN system; including an expansion of the membership, a greater role for global democratic participation including a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, and a move away from the veto-nature of the UNSC that has paralysed the world's foremost decision making forum for international security for years. 

Such an EU seat could be established by transferring the French UNSC seat to the EU, or transform the new German seat (along with the aforementioned new country additions) into an EU representation.

The veto should be thoroughly reformed taking into account legitimate concerns of Central and Eastern European states.

Below, I propose a substantial two-stage reform:

A list of possible such reasons could be defined as follows: foreign relations, defence, family law, finances, taxation. Each state would thus have no more than five vetoes during the period. Votes about the accession of new member states and treaty change should not be affected by the new rule. Such a proposal could be achieved without treaty change, if member states make a solemn declaration to respect the new rules.

In the meantime, treaties should be changed to replace the veto by a more productive suspensive veto. If a decision that would require unanimity under the current rules is not made unanimously, but is supported by a significant super-qualified majority, there shall be a second vote after a well-defined time period (say four weeks).

123190,Constitucion Federal para Federación Europea,"La Unión Europea tiene tres opciones:

* De vuelta al estado-nación de Westfalia

* Mantener la UE como está ahora: administración intergubernamental basada en un tratado

* Establecimiento de los Estados Unidos de Europa, basado en una constitución federal. Eso es lo que necesita Europa.

Desde la creación de los Estados Unidos federales por la Convención de Filadelfia de 1787, han fracasado numerosos intentos de establecer una Europa federal.   Robert Schuman, quien siempre es elogiado como el fundador de lo que hoy es la UE, ya habló de la necesidad de darle un alma a Europa en su Declaración Schuman del 9 de mayo de 1950. Abogó enérgicamente por la necesidad de una Europa federal, pero concluyó su Declaración con la instrucción a los líderes gubernamentales de basar esa Europa federal en tratados. Un error imperdonable. Los tratados no tienen alma. Sólo una constitución tiene alma, siempre que esté bien diseñada: de, por y para el pueblo.  Este sistema está cada vez más presionado por los conflictos. Y geopolíticamente, la UE no tiene sentido.      La Alianza Federal de Federalistas Europeos quiere hacer un nuevo intento de reemplazar el sistema operativo antidemocrático e ineficaz basado en tratados de la UE por una Europa federal firmemente democrática y eficaz. La Convención Ciudadana de FAEF de 55+ Participantes, es una respuesta a la ""Conferencia sobre el futuro de Europa"" de la UE y un homenaje a la visión original de Altiero Spinelli en su Manifiesto Ventotene  1941","The European Union has three options: * Back to the nation-state of Westphalia * Keep the EU as it is now: intergovernmental administration based on a treaty * Establishment of the United States of Europe, based on a federal constitution. That is what Europe needs. Since the creation of the federal United States by the Philadelphia Convention of 1787, numerous attempts to establish a federal Europe have failed. Robert Schuman, who is always praised as the founder of what is now the EU, already spoke of the need to give a soul to Europe in his Schuman Declaration of 9 May 1950. He strongly advocated the need for a federal Europe, but concluded his Declaration by instructing government leaders to base that federal Europe on treaties. An unforgivable mistake. Treaties have no soul. Only a constitution has a soul, provided it is well designed: from, by and for the people. This system is increasingly under pressure from conflicts. And geopolitically, the EU makes no sense. The Federal Alliance of European Federalists wants to make a new attempt to replace the undemocratic and ineffective operating system based on EU treaties with a firmly democratic and effective federal Europe. The FAEF Citizens’ Convention of 55+ Participants, is a response to the EU’s “Conference on the Future of Europe” and a tribute to Altiero Spinelli’s original vision in his Manifesto Ventotene 1941",Federal Constitution for European Federation,EUInTheWorld,es,4,comment_130681,,"Amigos,                                         Europa necesita es una Constitucion para  crear la Union Europea Federal primera videoconferencia con la Convencion de Ciudadanos el pasado 29 de octubre, se hablo de una transformacion del exito de la Union Europea, desde que en 1950 Schumann hizo la declaracion preparatoria que llevaria a la fundacion del MC (Mercado Comun) en 1957.

9406,Ejercito Europeo,"La mayoría de los países miembros de la UE son a su vez miembros de la OTAN. Actualmente todos los ejércitos adheridos al Tratado Atlántico están completamente adaptados a trabajar en un ámbito plurinacional. Se utilizan procedimientos y doctrina comunes, así como estructuras organizativas similares.

Si los soldados de los países de la alianza están acostumbrados a realizar sus tareas en coalición de forma satisfactoria ¿por qué no somos capaces de hacer lo mismo a nivel europeo? Esta pregunta deberían pateársela los dirigentes de los estados de la Union Europea.

Existen muchas competencias en materia de seguridad y defensa que a día de hoy están delegadas a la OTAN. Por poner un ejemplo, desde el Centro de Operaciones Aéreas Combinadas de Torrejón (CAOC TJ) se supervisa toda la defensa aérea de la mitad sur de Europa. ¿No sería más conveniente tener esas capacidades delegadas a la UE directamente?

Creo firmemente que realizar una política de seguridad y defensa común, así como integrar los ejércitos nacionales en un Ejercito Europeo supondría una mejora cualitativa en esta materia.  Así mismo se podría realizar una reestructuración a nivel de Unidades y Estados mayores en la cual se suprimieran competencias duplicadas, lo que supondría una mejora en la economía de medios. 

Por otra parte, trabajar día a día con personas de distintos países fomentaría la cohesión y valores europeos entre la población.","Most EU member countries are in turn members of NATO. At present, all the armies acceding to the Atlantic Treaty are fully adapted to work on a multi-country level. Common procedures and doctrine are used, as well as similar organisational structures. If the soldiers of the alliance countries are accustomed to carrying out their tasks as a coalition satisfactorily, why are we not able to do the same at European level? This question should be kicked out by the leaders of the states of the European Union. There are many security and defence powers that are now delegated to NATO. For example, the Torrejón Combined Air Operations Centre (CAOC TJ) oversees all air defence in southern half of Europe. Wouldn't it be more convenient to have those powers delegated to the EU directly? I firmly believe that implementing a common security and defence policy and integrating national armies into a European army would be a qualitative improvement in this area. A restructuring could also be carried out at the level of Units and Major States in which duplicated competences would be abolished, which would lead to an improvement in the media economy. On the other hand, working every day with people from different countries would foster European cohesion and values among the population.",European Exercise,EUInTheWorld,es,3,comment_13993,,"Es una excelente propuesta porque todos pensamos que la Unión Europea debe tener una sólida política de Defensa común.

219220,"Across the EU, the legal voting age for European Parliament elections should be lowered to 16.","Original author: David Toman

Ever since the first European elections in 1979, voter turnout had been continuously decreasing until 2019, which marked an increase in participation also thanks to younger people and first-time voters. This indicates that young people are interested in EU's future and are willing to actively participate in shaping it. Therefore, this proposal calls for lowering the voting age for the European elections to the age of 16. There are many reasons to consider this. First, by the age of 16, many young people already have adult responsibilities such as working part-time, volunteering, having a driving license (differs across Member States) etc. Second, examples like the 2014 Scottish independence referendum prove that young people show interest in voting and tend to actively seek information to make informed decisions. Third, lowering the voting age could increase voter turnout from multiple generations – not only that of younger people, but also their family members. Fourth, such change could bring more attention to the European elections and help open a discussion about the importance of the EU as a whole. This could also serve as an impetus to pay more attention to the EU in school curriculums. Finally, 2022 is the European Year of Youth and starting a discussion on lowering the voting age could be another step further in fulfilling the EU's policymaking and political priorities in this regard.","Original author: David Toman

8626,Risolvere la questione cipriota,"L'isola di Cipro, nel Mediterraneo orientale, ha da secoli a che fare con una divisione culturale enorme tra i suoi abitanti. A nord la popolazione è di prevalenza turca/ musulmana, a sud greca/ occidentale in generale. Questa divisione culturale ha visto il suo culmine quando nel 1983 è stata proclamata la Repubblica Turca di Cipro del Nord. 

Attualmente Cipro è quindi divisa in due: la Repubblica di Cipro, Stato membro dell'Unione Europea, e la KKTC sostenuta dai militari turchi. Nicosia è l'ultima capitale divisa d'Europa, con un muro, proprio come lo era Berlino una volta. Le violenze si sono interrotte effettivamente da diverso tempo, ma la sovranità dello Stato legittimo di Cipro è comunque messa in discussione, e insieme ad essa lo è tutta la sicurezza dell'Unione Europea.

 I negoziati per la soluzione della questione cipriota condotti nel corso degli anni hanno portato alla formulazione di una strategia per la creazione di uno Stato unitario. Tuttavia il Piano Annan, nato diverso tempo fa, non è mai stato applicato e non è in corso di applicazione perché rifiutato dai greco-ciprioti. L'Unione Europea, per il bene dei ciprioti e dell'unità europea che prospetta la creazione un unico Paese senza frontiere interne, deve intervenire per riaprire i negoziati e arrivare ad una soluzione entro breve. Se questo problema non verrà risolto ora, si presenterà in una forma più grave in futuro, impedirà la nascita degli Stati Uniti d'Europa e aumenterà la supremazia turca.","The island of Cyprus, in the eastern Mediterranean, has for centuries been involved in a huge cultural division among its inhabitants. In the north, the population is of Turkish/Muslim prevalence, in the south of Greece/West in general. This cultural division culminated when the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus was proclaimed in 1983. Cyprus is therefore currently divided into two: the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union, and the KKTC supported by Turkish soldiers. Nicosia is the last divided capital of Europe, with a wall, just like Berlin once. The violence has actually ceased for some time, but the sovereignty of the legitimate State of Cyprus is in any case called into question, and together with it is the entire security of the European Union. Negotiations on the settlement of the Cyprus problem over the years have led to the formulation of a strategy for the creation of a unitary state. However, the Annan Plan, which was born some time ago, has never been implemented and is not in the process of being implemented because it was refused by Greek Cypriots. The European Union, for the benefit of Cypriots and the European unity which envisages the creation of a single country without internal borders, must take action to reopen negotiations and reach a solution shortly. If this problem is not solved now, it will come in a more serious way in the future, prevent the emergence of the United States of Europe and increase Turkish supremacy.",Resolving the Cyprus issue,ValuesRights,it,4,comment_202064,,"Well said, Mirko.

L’Union européenne n’est pas seulement un marché mais aussi un espace de démocratie que doivent respecter les Etats membres signataires de ses Traités, mais aussi ses institutions.

On ne peut pas défendre l’éthique ni la Loi sans s’appuyer sur les principes qui les définissent : droit à la défense, présomption d’innocence, séparation des pouvoirs, souveraineté nationale, jugement motivé.

Il faut donc 

-	Confier à la Cour de Justice européenne la charge de juger, voire punir , les Etats dont certaines dispositions légales pourraient être contraires aux traités qu’ils ont signé.

-	Encourager au niveau national le respect des droits fondamentaux en s’appuyant sur l’opinion publique dont l’expression doit passer par un débat organisé, des associations citoyennes au Parlement. 

Il reste que la séparation des pouvoirs est la pierre angulaire de nos institutions et de notre démocratie ; ne risquerait-elle pas d’être remise en question par une conditionnalité de principe dans l’attribution des fonds (et non définie préalablement et limitée à un domaine) ? 

Cette mesure n’est-elle pas une insulte à la capacité d’évoluer par le dialogue entre pays, et à l’intérieur des pays  ? 

Et ne crée-t-on pas un risque de dérive vers un rapport de force entre partenaires, encourageant la création de groupes de pays pour résister aux courants plus puissants ?","The issue of fundamental rights is linked to the legitimacy of decision-making levels and must be debated before citizens. The European Union is not only a market but also an area of democracy that the Member States which have signed the Treaties must respect, but also its institutions.

It is therefore necessary to entrust the European Court of Justice with the task of judging or even punishing States whose legal provisions may be contrary to the treaties they have signed. — To encourage respect for fundamental rights at national level, based on public opinion, which must be expressed through an organised debate, from citizens’ associations to Parliament.

2016,End discrimination between individuals based on gender,"EU charter of fundamental rights Article 21 states:

“Any discrimination based on any ground such as sex, race, ... shall be prohibited.”

Article 23 states:

“The principle of equality shall not prevent the maintenance or adoption of measures providing for specific advantages in favour of the under-represented sex.”

I interpret this to mean that if some people of one gender are under-represented in some context then EU can start discriminating between individuals based on gender.

These two articles are in conflict. No individual is personally responsible for group representation so why should they be rewarded or punished for it?

EU’s Gender Equality Strategy makes many claims based on Article 23. Large amounts of money and effort are poured into helping those who belong to an under-represented gender group. Is this fair?

If two individuals are equally poor and in need of help, is it fair to help one of them more due to which gender group they belong to? For me the answer is simple: not fair!

A little perspective shift is in order. If single parents need help then help all individuals who are single parents. If drug addicts need help then help all individuals who are drug addicts. If victims of domestic violence need help then help all individuals who are victims of domestic violence. If unemployed individuals need help then help all unemployed individuals.

At no point do we need to care about which gender group is most affected. Just think of people as individuals.","EU charter of fundamental rights Article 21 states:

244234,Pacifisme en beschermend schild als preventie tegen oorlog,"Investeren in bescherming in de vorm van een schild of ons onzichtbaar maken voor precisiewapens en targets is, vanuit een pacifistische en waardengedreven visie, interessanter om oorlog te voorkomen dan zelf meedoen met bewapening, afstraffing of machtsvertoon. 

Net zoals een identiteitsverandering is dit een effectieve vorm van de-escalatie, omdat het de partijen de mogelijkheid geeft om veilig zich uit een conflict te verwijderen. Pas wanneer iedereen zich veilig voelt kan er sereniteit ontstaan. 

De intentie van de andere partij doet er enkel toe voor een veroordeling, straf of machtsvertoon, maar doet er niet toe voor beschermingsmaatregelen. Met bescherming doe je niemand kwaad en daarover kan dus wel unanimiteit bestaan. 

We mogen niet in de val van claimende types trappen. We moeten ons richten op deze oplossingen zoals een schild dat ons verbergt, omdat we zo zelf onafhankelijk actie kunnen nemen en we mogen ons daarbij niet laten afleiden door de drama van anderen.

Pacifisme wordt vaak misbegrepen als niets doen, terwijl het de meest krachtige actie is. Actie in plaats van reactie uit angst. Actie is investeren in een solide manier om ons te verbergen voor elk gevaar. Het is onze beste kans om te overleven, door een punt te maken om uit de puinhoop te blijven die anderen creëren, om onszelf te behouden als een waardengedreven natie en als mensheid trouw te blijven aan onszelf. De meest zekere optie opdat we veilig zijn en onafhankelijk kunnen handelen.","In order to prevent war, it is more interesting from a pacifist and value-driven vision to invest in prevention and protection in the form of a shield or to make us invisible to precision weapons or targets, rather than participating in armaments, punishment or show of power themselves. Just like a change of identity, this is an effective form of de-escalation, as it allows the parties to safely remove themselves from conflict. Only when everyone feels safe can serenity arise. We can't fall into the trap of claiming types. The intention of the other party only matters for a conviction, punishment or display of power, but does not matter for protective measures. With protection, you do not harm anyone, so unanimity can exist. We need to focus on these solutions such as a shield that hides us, because it allows us to take independent action ourselves, and we must not be distracted by the drama of others.",Pacifism and protective shield as prevention against war,ValuesRights,nl,1,comment_236348,,"The above comments are part of my idea about voting rights and should be read as such.

39306,LGBTQI+ awarness in Eastern European member states,"Sadly I’ve encountered many anti-LGBT posts in this conference, so I feel the need to explain the Western standpoint to the Eastern religious conservatives. 

Why are LGBT normal and equal to straight cis-gender people?

The love between two adult men/women is exactly the same as that between a man and a woman. A man can find another man attractive for exactly the same reasons as a woman would and vice versa. A woman’s effeminate personality can be born into a man’s body and vice versa. There are many biological and environmental factors that play into the development of someone’s sexual orientation and gender identity. Being LGBT is completely up to chance, develops naturally and has even been observed in animals. LGBT are equally able to live, pay taxes and love. Everybody should have the same chance to live their best and happiest life. This means the law must allow LGBT to marry, change their official gender, adopt children, be protected from hate, discrimination and violence. 

Pride

Since Rome adopted Christianity LGBT have been persecuted. It took 2000 years, better science and a lot of courage and activism for LGBT to fight for the rights they have today but the injustice still isn’t completely overcome and it will probably never be. That is why LGBT take pride in being who they really are and showing themselves even in spite of what others think, say and do to them. 

...","Sadly I’ve encountered many anti-LGBT posts in this conference, so I feel the need to explain the Western standpoint to the Eastern religious conservatives. 

Why are LGBT normal and equal to straight cis-gender people?

The love between two adult men/women is exactly the same as that between a man and a woman. A man can find another man attractive for exactly the same reasons as a woman would and vice versa. A woman’s effeminate personality can be born into a man’s body and vice versa. There are many biological and environmental factors that play into the development of someone’s sexual orientation and gender identity. Being LGBT is completely up to chance, develops naturally and has even been observed in animals. LGBT are equally able to live, pay taxes and love. Everybody should have the same chance to live their best and happiest life. This means the law must allow LGBT to marry, change their official gender, adopt children, be protected from hate, discrimination and violence.

With the EU Login the EU Citizens should have access to all their data, such as their medical file and criminal record. The EU Login should therefore be linked to the National e-ID as well as other public and government databases.

The EU Citizen can also give a yearly-access to their family doctor and dentist, so they have free access though every visit/view will be logged.

739,Digital Payment,"Mit der App, einer FinTec-App, sollen Digital-Payment-Anwender einen detaillierten Überblick über die gekauften und bezahlten Güter per Rechnung vom Verkäufer erhalten.

Die meisten bzw. viele Lieferanten / Verkäufer von Shopsystemen senden dem Käufer eine Rechnung an die ihm bekannte Mailadresse des Käufers, üblicherweise heute als pdf.

Dagegen sind heute alle digital-payments über den Einzelhandel bei Zahlung über einem Kassensystem nur mit dem Kassenbeleg, erstellt von dem Kassensystem, auf Papier erhältlich.

Das gleiche Problem steht sich bei der Gastronomie, auch dort wird üblicherweise ein Beleg von dem Kassensystem erstellt, auf Wunsch ein steuerlich erforderliche Bewirtungsbeleg für die Buchhaltung des Gastes (Käufer).

Mein Ziel ist es, eine App und Website zu entwickeln, die es ermöglicht, mobile-payments für Nutzer zu sammeln und diese digital langfristig zu speichern. Entscheidend haben „digital payment User“ damit einen Überblick über die bezahlten Güter und Leistungen und die App eine Suchfunktion über die digitalen Daten ermöglicht, und damit auch Probleme lösen kann:

- Wann habe ich dieses Produkt „xyz“ bei wem gekauft?

- Wann läuft die Garantie zu diesem Produkt aus?

- Der User hat nicht mehr den Kaufbeleg und kann damit nicht reklamieren

- …

- Ein Nutzeracount könnte die Payments von zusammengehörigen Personen (oder Firmenmitarbeiter) sammeln","The app, a FinTec app, is intended to provide digital payment users with a detailed overview of the goods purchased and paid by the seller through an invoice. Most or many of the shop-system suppliers/sellers send an invoice to the buyer’s email address known to the buyer, usually today as pdf. On the other hand, all digital payments at retail level are now available on paper only with the cash receipt created by the cash system. The same problem arises in the catering sector, where a receipt is usually drawn up by the cash system and, at the request of the gastronomy, a proof of hospitality required for tax purposes for the accounts of the guest (purchaser). My aim is to develop an app and website to collect mobile payments for users and store them digitally on a long-term basis. Digital payment users have thus made it possible to have an overview of the goods and services paid and the app to search for the digital data and to solve problems: — When did I buy this product ‘xyz’ from whom? — When does the guarantee for this product expire? — The user no longer has the proof of purchase and cannot therefore complain —... — A user acount could collect payments from associated persons (or company employees).",Digital Payment,Digital,de,5,comment_79074,,I think it is a good idea to define standards for digital transmission of receipts.

En Tinder todo muy bien quedamos y por convención social no nos volvemos a ver y así la gente tiene hasta 40 citas.

Y es que unos somos obesos, otros bajitos etc. y no cuadramos con las fotos... otros como yo han sido publicitados en las redes sociales sin modo de poder poner una denuncia y recibir la indemnización porque sólo es una sospecha.

206614,Pour une Union européenne fédérale,"L'Europe des nations n'a que trop duré et a montré depuis longtemps ces limites, à coup de veto au sein du Conseil, synonyme d'immobilisme et de décalage entre les attentes des citoyens européens qui réclament toujours ""plus"" d'Europe et les compétences réelles de l'UE et de ses différentes institutions.

Avoir une UE fédérale ne réglera pas tous les problèmes loin sans faux, mais cela permettra une meilleure lisibilité du fonctionnement de l'UE et de la façon dont sont prises les décisions. Ainsi que des avancés plus importantes et plus rapides sur les sujets clés pour l'avenir des Etats membres : environnement, société, emplois, santé, défense. En permettant de mener des politiques communes de grande envergure similaire à celle de la PAC. Le tout en sortant de l'impasse de l'unanimité que nous impose le système actuel.

Bien entendu, cette transition vers un Etat fédéral doit s'accompagner de processus de désignation démocratique des membres des différentes institutions qui formeront ce futur Etat, à l'aide d'élection directe ou indirecte, le tout garanti par une séparation effective des différents pouvoirs (législatif, exécutif et judiciaire) qui sont à la base de tout Etat démocratique.","The Europe of nations has lasted too long and has for a long time shown these limits, with veto in the Council, synonymous with immobility and a gap between the expectations of European citizens who always call for “more” Europe and the real competences of the EU and its various institutions. Having a federal EU will not solve all problems far from wrong, but it will make it easier to understand how the EU works and how decisions are taken. As well as more and faster progress on key issues for the future of the Member States: environment, society, jobs, health, defence. By enabling the conduct of large-scale common policies similar to that of the CAP. All the while breaking the impasse of unanimity imposed on us by the current system. Of course, this transition to a federal state must be accompanied by the process of democratic designation of the members of the various institutions that will form this future state, with the help of direct or indirect election, all guaranteed by an effective separation of the various powers (legislative, executive and judicial) which are the basis of any democratic state.",For a Federal European Union,Democracy,fr,2,comment_187045,,"Totalmente de acuerdo..!!!

44836,Verteidigungspolitik ,"Dass Nordafrika sich mit der EU am Mittelmeer befindet, zeigt, wie wichtig Stabilität dort ist. Dort werden Flüchtlingsprobleme gelöst oder verstärkt. Auch Energiepolitik kann im sonnigen Afrika gemacht werden. Das Thema ""neue Seidenstraße"" ist ebenfalls von herausragender Bedeutung.

Länder wie Tunesien, Marokko, Libyien, Algerien aber auch Syrien und Libanon sind wichtig für eine Zukunftsstrategie. Besonders Wohlstand wirkt gegen Flucht. Trotzdem sind eben auch Mali oder Somalia Schwerpunkte einer effektiven Flüchtlingspolitik, weil es dort an Sicherheit fehlt.

Syrien hat gezeigt, was ein militärisches Nicht-Eingreifen bewirken kann. Es hat zum größten Flüchtlingsstrom nach Europa geführt. 

Als Beispiel für die angeblich destabilisietende Auswirkung von Militäreinsätzen wird gerne der Irakkrieg genannt. Dabei war zuvor ein Polit-Mafiosi an der Macht, der überfallen, vergiftet und gefoltert hatte. Die Mär, IS sei Folge des Irak-Kriegs gewesen, ist dabei plumpe Propaganda. Es waren die Fehler des Statthalters Paul Bremer: Nicht-Beteiligung der Schiiten an den Petrodollars im Süden, Nicht-Klärung der Kurdenfrage im Norden und Ent-Baath-ifizierung von Beamten, Militär und Polizei in der Mitte.

Und der eigentliche Grund liegt in der Kolonialpolitik. In willkürlichen Grenzen. 

Dagegen hat der militärische Einsatz am Balkan für das Ende eines Völkermords gesorgt.

Europa hat die Verantwortung für seine alten Kolonien.","The fact that North Africa is on the Mediterranean with the EU shows the importance of stability there. There, refugee problems are solved or amplified. Energy policy can also be made in sunny Africa. The theme of “new Silk Road” is also of outstanding importance. Countries such as Tunisia, Morocco, Libya, Algeria, Syria and Lebanon are important for a future strategy. Especially prosperity works against flight. Nevertheless, Mali or Somalia are also the focal points of an effective refugee policy, because there is a lack of security. Syria has shown what military non-intervention can do. It has led to the largest flow of refugees to Europe. The Iraq War is often cited as an example of the supposedly destabilising impact of military operations. Previously, a political mafiosi was in power who had invaded, poisoned, and tortured. The Mar, that ISIS was the result of the Iraq war, is blatant propaganda. It was the mistakes of Governor Paul Bremer: Non-participation of the Shiites in the petrodollars in the south, non-clarification of the Kurdish question in the north and de-baath-ification of officials, military and police in the middle. And the real reason lies in colonial politics. In arbitrary limits. On the other hand, military intervention in the Balkans has brought an end to genocide. Europe has responsibility for its old colonies.",Defence policy,Democracy,de,0,comment_50524,,"Überhaupt muss sich die Europäische Union ganz pragmatisch auch die Frage stellen, wie stark und stabil selbst Europa sein kann, wenn um einen herum nur Krisenherde existieren. Ungeachtet auch der historischen Verantwortung, die wir wie Herr Wein schon richtig ausgeführt hat haben, haben wir darüber hinaus auch eine moralische Verantwortung Menschenrechte und das Recht auf Leben nicht nur innerhalb der Union sondern überall auch aktiv zu verteidigen. Dass es hierfür im Ministerrat eine Einstimmigkeit braucht und richtig und gut, denn niemand sollte einfach überstimmt werden, sich an militärischen Operationen zu beteiligen. Gleichzeitig reicht es einfach nicht mehr, dass nur Deutschland, Frankreich und die USA für Stabilität und Frieden in Nordafrika und im Nahen Osten sorgen möchten.

5518,Focus on Safe Alternative Voting Methods and BAN internet voting or internet enabled voting equipment.,"There is a clear consensus in the international academic community and the IT&C professionals’ community that cybersecurity and the inherent need for secrecy of the ballot in democratic elections is not yet possible via the internet.

The only alternative voting methods that cannot be systemically attacked are via correspondence (because no one person or small group of corrupt people can affect the overall outcome of the election) or ballot counting devices (citizens mark their options on a piece of paper and a machine tallies the results + there is a statistical audit of the ballots to ensure that the machines weren't malfunctioning or hacked).

Blockchain does nothing to safeguard the secrecy of the vote and analogies with banking systems are also false, because banks have a clear ledger of who you send money to and how much, and there are still countless frauds or errors that customers pay for in banking fees. There is no equivalent to these failures for votes.

Since electronic voting is not yet truly possible, due to the need for secrecy of the vote - which makes it impossible or very difficult (compared to the safer alternative voting methods) to audit if the vote cast was indeed cast by someone eligible to vote (voter identity) or if that vote was not altered before it was counted or by the administrators of the poll, I recommend the EU Parliament to discuss a ban on Internet or Internet enabled machine voting technologies and to actively promote the safe alternatives.","There is a clear consensus in the international academic community and the IT&C professionals’ community that cybersecurity and the inherent need for secrecy of the ballot in democratic elections is not yet possible via the internet.

L’Unione fa la forza e oggi ancora di più abbiamo bisogno di essere uniti per affrontare problemi globali. Per questo l’Ue di adesso non basta: abbiamo infatti bisogno di una sola politica economica, una sanità europea, un corpo militare europeo, un Presidente della Repubblica europeo, di rivolgerci alle potenze straniere come un’unica Nazione. Uniti, davvero uniti, saremmo la prima potenza mondiale, saremmo il vero faro dei valori dei diritti e delle libertà fondamentali, dello Stato sociale, della solidarietà umana che contraddistingue i nostri Stati.

Abbiamo bisogno che la Corte di giustizia acquisti il ruolo di sindacato di legittimità costituzionale dell’Europa, riunita come spero in una Federazione.

Bisogna mettere da parte gli egoismi interni insiti in ciascuno stato per portare avanti un sogno più grande, perché solo uniti si può sognare in grande, si può vivere in grande. Bisogna che tutti noi smettiamo di essere uomini piccoli trincerati nei nostri confini nazionali e guardiamo oltre: alla grandezza, perché solo uniti si può essere grandi.

We need the Court of Justice to acquire the role of reviewing the constitutional legitimacy of Europe, united as I hope in a Federation. The internal selfishness inherent in each state must be set aside in order to pursue a bigger dream, because only united can be dreamed in a big way, and we can live in a big way. We all need to stop being small men trapped on our national borders and look beyond: in size, because only unity can be large. The European dream is this.

6669,Neuaufstellung der EU,"Derzeit gibt die EU auf vielen Gebieten ein jämmerliches Bild ab. Das liegt an völlig unzulänglichen Regelungen, die mit der erheblichen - und grundsätzlich sehr zu begrüßenden - Erweiterung des Kreises der Mitgliedstaaten nicht ""mitgewachsen"" sind. So ist es möglich, dass es Mitglieder wie Polen und Ungarn gibt, die demokratische, rechtsstaatliche und menschenrechtliche Grundwerte zutiefst verachten und in ihrer Innen- wie Außenpolitik mit eisernen Füßen treten, Presse und Kultur unterdrücken. Gleichzeitig sind sie auf jeden Euro aus Brüssel angewiesen, weil sie sonst ihre Anti-EU- und Anti-Demokratie-Politik gar nicht betreiben, ihre Bevölkerung nicht korrumpieren und sich selbst nicht so unverschämt bereichern könnten. Sie verweigern jede zur Rettung der EU und ihrer Werte längst überfällige Regelveränderung, indem sie sich im Rahmen der Einstimmigkeit gegenseitig decken. Einen mit den bisherigen Regeln konformen Ausweg gibt es nicht.

Daher mein Vorschlag:

Die Staaten Frankreich, Italien, Spanien, Luxemburg, Belgien und BRD - gerne weitere, die sich der Initiative anschließen wollen - treten aus der EU aus und gründen noch am selben Tag eine neue EU: mit einem viel klareren, praktikableren, auf die EU-Werte verpflichtenden Regelwerk - inklusive Abschaffung der Einstimmigkeitsblockade, aber bei Wahrung von Minderheitsinteressen -  Sie bieten allen anderen bisherigen Mitgleidsstaaten an, sofort der neuen EU und ihren Regeln beizutreten.

Dies ist leider ein grobes Konzept.","In many areas, the EU is currently showing a juxtaposition. This is due to completely inadequate rules which have not “grown up” with the substantial — and in principle very welcome — enlargement of the circle of Member States. It is possible that there are members, such as Poland and Hungary, who deeply respect democratic, the rule of law and fundamental human rights values, and are fertile in their internal and foreign policies, suppressing the press and culture. At the same time, they depend on every euro from Brussels, because otherwise they would not be able to pursue their anti-EU and anti-democracy policies at all, to corrupt their people and not to enrich themselves so unscrupulously. They refuse any overdue change in the rules to save the EU and its values by tying each other through unanimity. There is no way forward in line with the current rules. Therefore, my proposal: The countries France, Italy, Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium and the Federal Republic of Germany — who wish to join the initiative — are leaving the EU and are setting up a new EU on the same day: with a much clearer and more practical set of rules that are binding on EU values — including the abolition of the unanimity block, but while safeguarding minority interests — you offer to all other Member States to join the new EU and its rules immediately.

To solve this problem, we should have a major reform of European elections based on proven best practices that brings MEPs as close as possible to citizens, and ensures that all Europeans are given the chance to vote on common projects. This means that every European citizen should have two votes: 

- one cast directly for a candidate on a local electoral district (~350 electoral districts across Europe); and

- one cast for a list covering the voter's Member States (for another 350 MEPs and a few more to ensure EU-wide party proportionality).

Crucially, direct candidates and lists will run under the name, logo and programme of a European political party.

This way, we bring MEPs as close as possible to the citizens they represent (especially MEPs elected locally who become a direct contact point for citizens) and we place European parties at the center of European elections, giving all European citizens the same political projects to choose from.","EU elections are currently 27 separate national elections, with limited possibility to vote on European topics.

130780,Renforcer les pouvoirs du PE mais laisser le droit d’initiative législative à la Commission européenne,"Depuis l’élection du PE au suffrage universel, la question de donner le pouvoir d’initiative au parlement européen est souvent soulevée. En soutien de cette position la question de la séparation des pouvoirs et souvent invoquée. 

Cependant, la Commission n’est pas l’organe exécutif européen, comme le sont les gouvernements dans les EM de l’UE. Il suffit de souligner que la Commission n’a pas les pouvoirs d’exécuter les lois votées par le pouvoir législatif (le Parlement) et les jugements et arrêts du pouvoir judiciaire (la Cour de justice) dans l’Union européenne.

En fait, le pouvoir exécutif en Europe est plutôt détenu par le Conseil : lorsque les ministres votent des règlements ou des directives, ils votent des textes qu’ils seront appelés à exécuter dans leur État membre.

Une Commission européenne sans le monopole de l’initiative législative perdrait son poids politique. Cet affaiblissement de la Commission ne serait en rien bénéfique pour l’Europe, qui passerait d’un triangle institutionnel qui a fait ses preuves à un duo institutionnel source de potentiels blocages législatifs.

La Commission doit donc garder son monopole de l’’initiative législative.

Il faut par ailleurs donner plus de pouvoirs au PE, notamment en renforçant la responsabilité de la Commission face au Parlement («accountability») en consacrant la désignation de son Président par le PE, mais aussi en donnant au PE un droit de regard sur le programme législatif annuel de la Commission.","Since the election of the EP by universal suffrage, the question of giving the European Parliament the power of initiative has often been raised. In support of this position, the issue of separation of powers and often invoked. However, the Commission is not the European executive body, as are governments in EU MS. Suffice it to point out that the Commission does not have the powers to enforce laws passed by the legislative power (the Parliament) and judgments and judgments of the judiciary (the Court of Justice) in the European Union. In fact, the executive power in Europe is rather held by the Council: when ministers vote on regulations or directives, they shall vote on texts which they will be required to implement in their Member State. A European Commission without the monopoly of legislative initiative would lose its political weight. This weakening of the Commission would in no way benefit Europe from a proven institutional triangle to an institutional duo that creates potential legislative bottlenecks. The Commission must therefore retain its monopoly on the legislative initiative. The EP must also be given more powers, in particular by strengthening the Commission’s accountability to Parliament by enshrining the EP’s nomination of its President, but also by giving the EP a right of scrutiny over the Commission’s annual legislative programme.",Strengthen the powers of the EP but leave the right of legislative initiative to the European Commission,Democracy,fr,26,comment_217340,,"Je soutiens l’objectif d’une Europe fédérale.

Cette évolution, si nécessaire, pourrait se faire en mettant en place une Europe à plusieurs vitesses. Cela permettrait aux Etats-membres qui souhaitent plus d’intégration d’aller de l’avant tout en respectant la décision de ceux qui ne souhaitent pas progresser davantage vers plus de fédéralisme.

Une telle évolution implique que l’Union européenne supprime le vote à l’unanimité au Conseil, qui équivaut à un droit de véto, et qui subsiste encore dans huit domaines : la politique étrangère et de sécurité commune, la citoyenneté, l'adhésion, la fiscalité indirecte, le financement de l'Union, la sécurité sociale, certaines dispositions de justice et des affaires intérieures, et dans les cas où le Conseil veut s'écarter des propositions de la Commission si celle-ci n'accepte pas ses amendements.

En conclusion, l’Union européenne doit évoluer vers le vote à la majorité qualifiée dans tous les domaines, sauf éventuellement pour l’adhésion de nouveaux pays, la Justice et les Affaires intérieures et à ce stade, la politique étrangère et de sécurité commune. 

Lorsque c’est possible, le passage de l’unanimité à la majorité qualifiée pourrait se faire en ayant recours aux clauses passerelles du Traité de Lisbonne.","With regard to the issue of governance of the European Union and the strengthening of democracy, the evolution towards federalism is the only way to enable Europe to move forward.

Such a development implies that the European Union abolishes unanimity voting in the Council, which is equivalent to a veto right, and which still remains in eight areas: common foreign and security policy, citizenship, accession, indirect taxation, Union financing, social security, certain justice and home affairs provisions, and in cases where the Council wishes to depart from the Commission’s proposals if the Commission does not accept its amendments.

Un tel processus instituant citoyen est la condition d’une nouvelle étape de l’UE. Nourri des acquis de la démocratie délibérative, il devrait s’organiser en deux étapes : au niveau de villes et des régions ; puis au niveau européen.

Au niveau des villes et des régions, pour rompre avec l’idée « d’intérêts nationaux » et  la crainte des Etats de voir se dissoudre dans l’Europe leur propre identité. Ces panels de citoyens devraient travailler pendant six mois autour de deux questions essentielles : quels sont les défis communs du monde au 21e siècle ? et quelle réponse  l’Europe est-elle capable d’y apporter. Puis, seconde étape, une Assemblée citoyenne européenne de 1000 citoyens délégués par les panels locaux mettra en commun les réflexions et les propositions.","The European construction was based on the unification of the market, a remedy after the rejection of the European Defence Community in 1954. This strategy has been effective, but as world trade has itself unified, the Union has become the soft belly of economic globalisation and a political dwarf. The difficulty of strengthening the Union has a root cause: the single market, the common currency, the status of a European citizen are not enough to raise the awareness of a community of destiny, to bring about the emergence of a “European people”. To do this, European citizens need to explain one another about their values, their worldview, their priorities, their fears, their hopes. Such a citizen-building process is a prerequisite for a new stage in the EU. Based on the achievements of deliberative democracy, it should be organised in two stages: at the level of cities and regions; then at European level. At the level of cities and regions, to break with the idea of “national interests” and the fear of states that their own identity will be dissolved in Europe. These citizen panels should work for six months on two key issues: what are the common challenges of the world in the 21st century? and what response is Europe capable of bringing to them. Then, second step, a European Citizens’ Assembly of 1000 citizens delegated by the local panels will share reflections and proposals.",Raising awareness of a European people through a citizen-building process,Democracy,fr,7,comment_69269,,"Bienvenue Ina à cette proposition qu'avait fait Pierre Calame dès les années 2010 en constatant qu'il n'y avait pas de base citoyenne à la construction européenne.

Das Parlament der Europäische Union möge für die Taxonomie-Verordnung beschließen, dass ausschließlich erneuerbare Energien (Wasser, Sonne, Wind, Biomasse) und Geothermie sowie ggf. Speicherstoffe die aus diesen gewonnen werden als besonders förderwürdig im Sinne der Taxonomie eingestuft werden. 

Begründung: Die Begrenzung auf diese stellt sicher, unter einem Label der Nachhaltigkeit nur etwas gefördert wird, dass es auch ist. Die EU-Kommission hat mit ihrem Vorschlag zur Taxonomie-Verordnung auch Kernenergie und Gas unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen als besonders förderwürdig eingestuft. Damit wäre das Label von Beginn an ad absurdum geführt, weil Kernenergie teurer als Strom aus Wind und Sonne ist, mehr Nebenwirkungen hat dessen Endlagerund ungeklärt ist. Darüber hinaus wird beim Gaspreis gerade deutlich, was Rohstoff-Abhängigkeiten gegenüber unsicheren Drittstaaten bedeuten - mehr Risiken für die Versorgung in der EU. Hauptlieferant von Uran ist derzeit Kasachstan. Europa stellt damit sicher, das Energie nachhaltiger, sicherer und günstiger wird sowie mehr Stabilität durch mehr Unabhängigkeit von Rohstoffpreisen.

Dessen ungeachtet kann jedes Land in nationaler Regie weiterhin fördern, was es möchte.

#taxonomie #greendeal #greenwashing #nextgeneu #nogreenwashing","An EU taxonomy regulation against greenwashing is a good idea to promote better assessments of sustainable investments. For the taxonomy regulation, the Parliament of the European Union should decide that only renewable energies (water, sun, wind, biomass) and geothermal energy and, if necessary, storage materials obtained from them are classified as particularly eligible for taxonomy. Justification: The limitation to this ensures that under a label of sustainability only something is promoted that it is. In its proposal on the Taxonomy Regulation, the European Commission has also classified nuclear energy and gas as particularly eligible under certain conditions. This would make the label ad absurd from the outset, because nuclear energy is more expensive than electricity from the wind and the sun, with more side-effects and unexplained repositories. In addition, the gas price is just showing what raw material dependence on insecure third countries means — more risks to supply in the EU. The main supplier of uranium is currently Kazakhstan. Europe is thus ensuring that energy becomes more sustainable, safer and cheaper, as well as more stability through greater independence from raw material prices.

The State should be obliged to examine and respond to any recommendation or complaint within specific time limits. If the citizen does not receive an answer or is not satisfied with the answer, he or she can turn to another committee. In each ministry there is an independent team that directly handles all matters. In this way, citizens will be able to make a substantial contribution to the governance of each country, feel respectful, report on waste, make huge savings and generally clean up corruption and conflict. Think in a cabinet that becomes a sucker or illegality or ignorance or abomination, that anyone can compel it, immediately investigate and render justice.

Discovering the citizens’ power,"Greta Thunberg inspired a spontaneous action of millions of citizens’ who saw the climate change as a real threat to our lives. It worked brilliantly well but one must wonder why such an action was at all needed. Why had citizens to force the governments to act. There must be something seriously wrong with democracy. It is the imbalance between the power of voters and politicians. 

The cause of that imbalance starts at an election, where the parties’ manifesto is tuned to temporal whims of the electorate. Once the votes have been cast, voters cannot rectify bad laws passed. Citizens as voters can hold politicians to account only on the day of the election. 

The first step towards a continuous oversight of the elected politicians might be a citizens’ ‘reinforced’ petition system. Its key function would be to trigger the calling by a valid petition, a session of a new chamber, a Citizens’ Senate, rather than an irregular Citizens’ Assembly,.

And here is the role for a campaign like an Extinction Rebellion, which may be renamed – Citizens’ Rebellion. It should demand that a parliament sets a new law allowing valid petitions to trigger the calling of a Citizens’ Senate session. Decisions of the Senate would have the power of a draft legislation. The parliament could only reject it with a qualified majority.

L’article 4 énonce que « les règlements et les autres textes de portée générale sont rédigés dans les langues officielles », et l’article 5 précise que « le Journal officiel de l'Union européenne paraît dans les langues officielles. » On ne saurait donc confondre « rédiger » et « publier » et on peut en déduire que toutes les langues officielles, qui sont également langues de travail, ont vocation à être utilisées pour rédiger les documents de portée générale produits par les institutions européennes.

Non seulement il conviendrait d’élever les compétences linguistiques des fonctionnaires européens, mais les progrès spectaculaires obtenus par la traduction assistée par ordinateur permettent de développer de nouvelles pratiques qui respectent pleinement l’esprit des traités et la lettre du règlement n° 1.

Not only should the language skills of European officials be raised, but the dramatic progress achieved by computer-assisted translation makes it possible to develop new practices that fully respect the spirit of the Treaties and the letter of Regulation No 1. Drafters can easily be expected to draft their texts in the language of their choice from among the 24 official languages and translate them immediately (even simultaneously) into at least two other official languages.

8515,Non può esserci vera democrazia europea senza un potere fiscale autonomo dell’UE. ,"Storicamente la creazione del potere fiscale ha coinciso con l’atto fondativo di una comunità politica, e ha richiesto un forte controllo democratico su chi lo esercita; per questo le società democratiche hanno sempre richiesto che il potere fiscale venisse esercitato dal parlamento. Oggi l’attribuzione del potere fiscale al Parlamento europeo (insieme al Consiglio dell’UE, in base alla procedura legislativa ordinaria) è una condizione indispensabile per la costruzione di un’Unione europea dotata di efficacia nell’azione politica e pienamente democratica.

Attualmente, il bilancio UE dipende dalla volontà dei singoli Stati membri. Per quanto riguardo le entrate, l’art. 311 TFUE stabilisce che il sistema delle risorse proprie sia deciso dal Consiglio all’unanimità e che in seguito la decisione sia approvata dai singoli Stati membri conformemente alle rispettive norme costituzionali. In tale procedura l’organo rappresentativo dei cittadini – il Parlamento europeo – viene solo consultato e ogni governo mantiene il diritto di veto sulla questione delle risorse trasferite e poi utilizzate dal bilancio UE. 

Questo meccanismo di finanziamento deve essere riformato in modo che l’UE possa disporre della capacità autonoma di prelevare direttamente delle imposte europee sulle imprese e sui cittadini senza passare attraverso l’armonizzazione preventiva delle imposte nazionali e pertanto senza l’intervento dei bilanci nazionali.

Per approfondire: https://sway.office.com/G7hZEy9Cck14kVi3","Historically, the creation of fiscal power coincided with the founding act of a political community, and required strong democratic control over those who exercise it; this is why democratic societies have always called for fiscal power to be exercised by the parliament. Today, the attribution of fiscal power to the European Parliament (together with the Council of the EU under the ordinary legislative procedure) is a prerequisite for building a European Union that is effective in political action and fully democratic. At present, the EU budget depends on the will of individual Member States. As regards revenue, Article 311 TFEU provides that the system of own resources is to be decided unanimously by the Council and that the decision is then approved by the individual Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements. In this procedure, the representative body of the citizens — the European Parliament — is only consulted and each government retains the right to veto the issue of resources transferred and then used by the EU budget. This financing mechanism needs to be reformed so that the EU has the autonomous capacity to levy European taxes directly on businesses and citizens without going through the preventive harmonisation of national taxes and therefore without the intervention of national budgets.

74515,Le budget européen vaut bien un débat démocratique,"Depuis les années 80 (« I want my money back »), l’Union européenne est dotée d’un budget très modeste (environ 1% du produit intérieur brut cumulé des 27). S’agissant de financements qui retournent dans les pays à plus de 90% (politique agricole commune, politiques régionales, recherche, etc.), ce budget génère beaucoup d’effets positifs dans les différents territoires de l’UE (1,7% à 2% de PIB, avec le cofinancement), pour un coût qui reste minimal (1 café/jour/citoyen). C'est la “valeur ajoutée” européenne.

Tous les 7 ans, les Etats membres fixent les priorités du budget pluriannuel européen et se concentrent chacun sur la contribution respective de leur pays (le « juste retour »). Pourtant, ceux qui contribuent plus qu’ils ne reçoivent du point de vue comptable (Allemagne, Pays-Bas, Danemark, Suède) tirent les plus grands bénéfices (économiques) du marché unique, ce qui entraine une divergence croissante entre les pays. Dans le cadre de la lutte contre la fausse information diffusée sur l’UE, cette réalité devrait être communiquée aux citoyens.

Cela n’a rien d’impossible, avec l’aide du monde associatif et du Parlement européen. Car le débat budgétaire a trait à l’action européenne et aux biens communs qu’elle produit, qu’il s’agisse du climat, de la cohésion sociale et territoriale ou de la politique de santé commune. Ce débat est un véritable fondement de la démocratie européenne et les citoyens doivent en être informés et y être associés.","Since the 1980s (‘I want my money back’), the EU has had a very small budget (about 1 % of the total gross domestic product of the 27). As regards funding that returns to countries at more than 90 % (common agricultural policy, regional policies, research, etc.), this budget generates many positive effects in the different EU territories (1.7 % to 2 % of GDP, with co-financing), at a cost that remains minimal (1 coffee/day/citizen). This is the European ‘added value’. Every 7 years, Member States set priorities for the European multiannual budget and each focus on the respective contribution of their country (the “just return”). However, those who contribute more than they receive from an accounting point of view (Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden) derive the greatest (economic) benefits from the single market, leading to a growing divergence between countries. As part of the fight against false information disseminated about the EU, this reality should be communicated to citizens. This is not impossible, with the help of the community and the European Parliament. The budgetary debate concerns European action and the common goods it produces, whether it be climate, social and territorial cohesion or the common health policy.

10887,Création d'un organe juridique indépendant chargé des crimes portant atteinte à l'intégrité du vivant ou à la régénération de la biosphère.,"Je ne suis pas juriste ni spécialiste de la question mais, pour caricaturer, il est naif de croire que la reconstruction écologique et climatique de nos sociétés européennes puissent se faire avec à notre tête la finance et l'économie. Il faut pouvoir juger les crimes portant atteinte à l'intégrité du vivant ou à la régénération de la biosphère.

Nous avons, par le passé créé des tribunaux internationaux. Les tribunaux spéciaux internationaux se sont principalement développés en matière pénale. Les premiers ont été les TMI de Nuremberg et de Tokyo. Parallèlement à la création de la Cour pénale internationale (CPI), en 2002, sont apparus plusieurs tribunaux mixtes et hybrides internationaux qui sont des juridictions nationales avec une participation internationale, comme le Tribunal spécial pour le Liban. Ces juridictions ont été créées sur la base d’un accord ou d’un acte international en empruntant au droit interne de l’État concerné. Elles sont internationalisées par leur personnel, leur fonctionnement et les catégories de crimes visés. Malgré les obstacles politiques rencontrés parfois dans leur mise en œuvre, ce type de juridiction pourrait être vu comme conciliant les intérêts d’une justice internationale et le respect de la souveraineté de l’État, avec en plus un coût financier moins élevé. Et pour ce qui est du crime visé, c'est tout simplement la notion de crime écologique (crime contre la biodiversité, crime environnemental, écocide...)","I am not a lawyer or a specialist in the matter, but to blame it is to believe that the ecological and climate reconstruction of our European societies can be carried out with our head of finance and the economy. Crimes against the integrity of the living or the regeneration of the biosphere must be judged. We have created international tribunals in the past. International special tribunals have developed mainly in criminal matters. The former were the MIC in Nuremberg and Tokyo. In parallel to the establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in 2002, several international mixed and hybrid courts emerged as national courts with international participation, such as the Special Tribunal for Lebanon. Those courts were established on the basis of an international agreement or act by borrowing from the domestic law of the State concerned.

Voorbeeld : 70 % van de Nederlandse handel gaat met EU-staten en de wederzijdse afhankelijkheid is groot!  En de voordelen van een exporterend land als Nederland  zijn veel groter dan de kosten, maar je kunt dat vertalen naar ALLE lidstaten door concreet te laten zien, hoe het evenwicht via bijv. subsidies wordt gezocht. Concreet kun je dat maken met bijv. de Coronacrisis : mobiliteit is een groot probleem, maar ook productie van medicijnen, afstemming van beleid door de landen enz. : daar heb je een centraal sturende organisatie voor nodig!

The number of mobile EU citizens today is very significant and future consequences may include an increase of bi-national couples – with children often holding multiple EU nationalities and living across multiple Member States. There should be no incentives within the EU to have the feeling to be worse-off as a multi-nationality holder (or having a pan-European rather than national identity). Involvement in public life should be facilitated as there usually is a natural bias against multi-nationality holders and even on an EU level, everything is still pretty much Member State channelled. This may have future consequences on the shaping of the political debate with those who grow up in a multi-national, multi-residency, or even multi-identity setting being deterred from participation. At the very least, on an EU level political involvement of these individuals should be encouraged and creating truly pan-European representation (not Member State channelled) within its own frame should be envisaged – including the already discussed transnational lists for Parliament, but also opening up other EU institutions to this representation.

Some 80-90 regional, minority or endangered languages (RMLs) are spoken across Europe which enjoy different degrees of official recognition. To a greater or lesser extent, languages with no official status at the EU nor at the State level are at serious risk. However, the EU has given insufficient attention to the issues concerning the minorities or regional languages on the EU agenda. The following actions, if implemented, would ensure that the EU translates its positive vision regarding linguistic diversity into concrete, tangible and far-reaching measures:

- The EP should encourage the adoption of a European Charter of Linguistic Rights based on existing legal frameworks such as the Universal Declaration of Languages Rights and article 22 of the CFR. 

- The EU should provide full protection to the languages of Europe by acknowledging their intrinsic value and granting them the highest possible degree of recognition; to ensure that all languages of the EU are eligible to participate in EU programs, initiatives and projects.

- Teaching and learning of the RMLs and the implementation of the so-called language immersion model as an effective system that fosters full knowledge of both the RML and the majority language should be encouraged.

- Digitalisation: the increasing importance & development of AI require the creation of lang resources and tools in European RMLs.","Languages are the most direct expression of culture and are an integral element of the European identity.

Why not increase the total Erasmus budget, so university students have the same level of funding as at present, but change the percentages so that more money is available for vocational training and apprenticeships? 

This will help a wider range of people to experience a direct personal benefit from the EU, and it will help to break down barriers among those who suffer the most during periods of economic downturn, perhaps making them less likely to ""blame foreigners"".

An Schulen in Bulgarien, Kroatien und Slowenien wurde 2018 und 2019 ein innovativer Ansatz im Rahmen von Erasmus+ erprobt. Beim Programm ""Multilingual Accelerator"" (https://bit.ly/lernbeschleuniger) wurden 8- und 9-jährigen Schulkindern zuerst Kenntnisse der logisch aufgebauten, lebenden Sprache Esperanto vermittelt. Die Kinder konnten anschließend eine zweite Sprache in kürzerer Zeit und mit besserem Ergebnis erlernen als Schüler in Kontrollgruppen, die unmittelbar mit der anderen Sprache angefangen hatten. Die Lehrer, erfahrene Fremdsprachenpädagogen ohne vorherige Esperanto-Kenntnisse, konnten das Unterrichtskonzept bereits nach kurzer Schulung umsetzen.

Die EU sollte die Bildungsministerien aller Mitgliedstaaten aufrufen, dieses Konzept in größerem Umfang an Schulen zu erproben, und die EU sollte diese Schulversuche finanziell unterstützen. Unter wissenschaftlicher Begleitung sollte ermittelt werden, ob das Erlernen von Fremdsprachen angesichts der so erzielbaren Effizienzgewinne in der gesamten EU auf diese Weise optimiert werden kann.","How do we deal with Europe’s linguistic diversity, which is both rich and challenging? Europeans lack the necessary language skills to communicate directly with each other. Few people can follow foreign-language media or even discuss them in another language and express themselves in a nuanced way. The EU must aim to radically improve the learning of foreign languages. An innovative Erasmus+ approach was tested in schools in Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovenia in 2018 and 2019. Under the programme “Multilingual Accelerator” (https://bit.ly/lernbeschleuniger), 8- and 9-year-old school children first learned the logically built, living language Esperanto. The children were then able to learn a second language in a shorter time and with a better result than students in control groups who had started directly with the other language. The teachers, experienced foreign language educators without prior Esperanto knowledge, were able to implement the teaching concept after short training. The EU should call on the education ministries of all Member States to test this concept more widely in schools, and the EU should financially support these school trials. Scientific support should be carried out to determine whether foreign language learning can be optimised in this way in view of the efficiency gains that can be achieved across the EU.",Linguistic diversity in the EU: Wealth or problem?

243376,European Survey on Youth's Historical consciousness ,"We suggest a Europe-wide survey – with specific and in depth questions – to investigate historical consciousness as a complex combination of students’ historical and political socialization, their interpretations of the past, their perceptions of the present, their expectations for the future, and the linkages they make among different time dimensions. Historical consciousness is understood as a form of self-positioning in the world, and a central part of individual and collective identity, bearing on values and interests, influencing attitudes and actions. It is the place where the processes of communication, socialization and education about the past intertwine.

Such a survey can provide objective elements of comparison across European countries about the cultural challenges ahead in the formation of collective identities, of national and European belonging. This can reshape our approach to European identity which is overloaded with value assumptions of the observers. In the age of pedagogy of memory, of mediated memories and of politics of memory, it is important to explore how students, adolescents and young adults make sense of history and of European culture; how history education at school and public uses of the past intertwine and affect youth’s historical consciousness. Empirical research concerning these topics has been rather limited or fragmentary and hardly comparable.

20000,Haushaltsführung,"Eine Skepsis gegenüber der europäischen Idee kann ich bei der großen Mehrheit der EU-Bevölkerung nicht feststellen. Was es aber tatsächlich gibt ist eine negative Grundeinstellung gegenüber der ausufernden EU-Bürokratie, die aus meiner Sicht zumindest in Teilen auch berechtigt ist.  Der Haushalt der EU lässt nicht erkennen welche politischen und sozialwirtschaftlichen Schwerpunkte verfolgt werden. Der Haushalt erscheint wie bunter Strauß an Ausgaben um möglichst alle Mitgliedsstaaten zu befriedigen anstatt dringende Probleme zu lösen. Seit über 30 Jahren gibt es nahezu keine Änderung bei den hohen Ausgaben der Agrarsubventionen mit dem Ziel diese ökologisch auszurichten oder scheint auch die teilweise sehr hohe Jugendarbeitslosigkeit kein wichtiges Thema zu sein. Warum beraumt die EU-Spitze nicht einen Sondergipfel zu diesem Thema ein?

What is true, however, is a negative basic attitude towards the excessive EU bureaucracy, which, in my view, is also justified, at least in part. The EU budget does not indicate which political and social economic priorities are being pursued. The budget seems to be spent as much as possible in order to cover all Member States rather than solving urgent problems. For over 30 years, there has been almost no change in the high expenditure of agricultural subsidies to make them environmentally friendly, or the sometimes very high youth unemployment rate does not seem to be an important issue either. Why is EU leaders not planning a special summit on this topic? The EU bureaucracy, which is completely out of hand, should also be reduced as soon as possible and funds freed up should be used to combat youth unemployment. For example, the salaries of EU officials and other employees are on average 30 to 50 % higher than those of comparable civil servants or employees in Germany or France. The corresponding remuneration can be derived in a transparent manner from the respective calls for tenders. I therefore argue that the number of EU employees should be significantly reduced (around 30 %) and that salaries should also be adjusted accordingly.

69,Common Individual Tax Base in the EU,"The introduction of a “Common Individual Tax Base” would force to arrive at a common definition of tax residency and overcome issues regarding double tax, capital gains, dividends, personal allowances etc. It would also make it more equitable in terms of tax deductions/tax credits (pension and health contributions, education, children/family status etc). The final taxable income would then be apportioned to Member States and being taxed at their respective rates, applying progressivity ranges on a proportional basis. Just as with the “currency snake in the tunnel”, steps here could see a “fiscal snake in the tunnel” approach proving useful, with Member States having some leeway within an agreed range, to arrive at a slow but steady consensus over time. 

This move simplify the individual tax system and create a better level-playing field for individuals in the EU. It should not be “more expensive” to have children in one Member State over another e.g. It would also solve issues around pensions, where some countries tax contributions while others tax pensions and “claiming relief” (a burden on individuals which creates its own issues), if any, is not straight forward in many regards and may result in an imbalance due to the difference in laws or cash flow difficulties. Finally it would solve inheritance tax issues by implementing the EC Experts Group’s (2015) preferred recommendation with the applicable tax system being based on the habitual residence of the deceased.","The introduction of a “Common Individual Tax Base” would force to arrive at a common definition of tax residency and overcome issues regarding double tax, capital gains, dividends, personal allowances etc. It would also make it more equitable in terms of tax deductions/tax credits (pension and health contributions, education, children/family status etc).

Just as with the “currency snake in the tunnel”, steps here could see a “fiscal snake in the tunnel” approach proving useful, with Member States having some leeway within an agreed range, to arrive at a slow but steady consensus over time. 

This move simplify the individual tax system and create a better level-playing field for individuals in the EU. It should not be “more expensive” to have children in one Member State over another e.g. It would also solve issues around pensions, where some countries tax contributions while others tax pensions and “claiming relief” (a burden on individuals which creates its own issues), if any, is not straight forward in many regards and may result in an imbalance due to the difference in laws or cash flow difficulties.

Umgekehrt: Deutschland sollte  die genannten Aufgaben auch dann ver­wirklichen, wenn sich die Nachbarländer (noch) dagegen sperren.

Schliesslich: Seit Jahren hören wir Argumente im Überfluss, warum das alles nicht gehe. Für die Zukunft Europas braucht es statt dessen kon­struktive Kritik, Ideen für Lösungen und Mut.

15314,Europa del siglo XXI,"Soy un ciudadano europeo, de nacionalidad española, que vivió en su juventud el nacimiento de la Unión Europea y como licenciado en derecho se fue a estudiar derecho europeo a la Universidad católica de Lovaina y hacer prácticas en la comisión europea porque el proyecto Europa era algo innovador y un sueño digno de apoyar. Todo esto ocurrió desde 1980 hasta el 2000.

En aquella época se pusieron las hebillas de una Europa unida, democrática, y más fuerte que nunca. Pero estamos en 2021 y todos aquellos sueños se han estancado. 

Por qué ha ocurrido esto?  Pues desde mi punto de vista todo ha quedado quedado paralizado por las siguientes razones:

En primer lugar porque los países no han sido capaces de ceder su soberanía en determinados asuntos donde debería de haber una sola política común europea, los cuales serían la economía, política exterior, sanidad, política migratoria, educación y seguridad y justicia. Y lo único que conseguimos fue tener una moneda común y el BCE. El resto, casi nada (Erasmus en educación), o casi nada.

En segundo lugar porque los políticos nos han quitado el poder a los ciudadanos y siguen haciendo y deshaciendo el futuro de nuestras naciones y pueblos sin consultarnos y a través de partidos políticos que escogemos en listas cerradas que me parece completamente injusto. Eso no es democracia. Debemos devolver el poder a los ciudadanos consultándoles a través de referéndums continuos de manera electrónica.

Y mil cosas más…","I am a European citizen, of Spanish nationality, who lived in his youth at the birth of the European Union and as a graduate in law, he was to study European law at the Catholic University of Leuven and to practise at the European Commission because the Europe project was something innovative and a dream worthy of support. All this occurred from 1980 to 2000. At that time, the buckles of a united, democratic and stronger Europe than ever before came into being. But we are in 2021 and all dreams have stagnated. Why has this happened? In my view everything has been halted for the following reasons: Firstly, because countries have not been able to give up their sovereignty on certain matters where there should be a single common European policy, which would be the economy, foreign policy, health, migration policy, education and security and justice. And we only managed to have a common currency and the ECB. The rest, almost nothing (Erasmus in education), or almost nothing. Secondly, because politicians have taken power away from our citizens and continue to do and dissolve the future of our nations and peoples without consulting us and through political parties that we choose on closed lists that seem to me to be completely unfair.

42110,Como resolver de una vez el problema de la vivienda.,"Hay un método de valoración de inmuebles que permite asegurar que cada familia tenga una vivienda. El método de capitalización de rentas.

La valoración de hospitales, hoteles, gasolineras, centros comerciales, colegios, polideportivos, tanatorios, cines, teatros, etc., se basa en el principio de que su valor depende de la RENTAbilidad que de ellos se obtiene.

El método de valoración es el de capitalización de RENTAS.

Sin embargo, para valorar las viviendas se aplica el método de comparación.

Una definición deValor:

El valor (de un inmueble obtenido por el método de comparación) es un indicador subjetivo e incluye la ventaja competitiva frente a otros productos o servicios. Es el importe que se está dispuesto a pagar por algo.

Especialmente condicionado por la escasez o sobreoferta del producto.

Es difícil de cuantificar ya que es un indicador subjetivo.

Y es un valor especulativo.

Tras la crisis del 2008 y las demás crisis que vamos enlazando una tras otra hasta la fecha, tras comprobar la dudosa efectividad de la valoración inmobiliaria y la gestión hipotecaria, tras comprobar su resultados y efectos devastadores en la sociedad (desahucios, escasez de vivienda social) la propuesta es:

El método de comparación no es correcto y sobre todo asigna a las viviendas un valor especulativo.

También las viviendas deberían valorarse por RENTAS.

Valoremos las viviendas por RENTAS.

En la imagen: valoración de vivienda en función de un salario tipo y de la renta per cápita de un barrio.","There is a real estate valuation method that ensures that each family has a home. The method of income capitalisation. The assessment of hospitals, hotels, gas stations, shopping centers, schools, sports halls, tanatories, cinemas, theaters, etc., is based on the principle that their value depends on the profitability obtained from them. The valuation method is that of RENTAS capitalisation. However, the method of comparison is applied to assess housing. A definition of value: The value (of a property obtained by the comparison method) is a subjective indicator and includes the competitive advantage over other products or services. That’s the amount you're willing to pay for something. Especially conditioned by the shortage or oversupply of the product. It is difficult to quantify as it is a subjective indicator. And it’s a speculative value. After the crisis of 2008 and the other crises that we are linking one after the other to date, after verifying the dubious effectiveness of real estate valuation and mortgage management, after verifying its results and devastating effects on society (evictions, social housing shortages) the proposal is: The method of comparison is not correct and, above all, assigns a speculative value to housing.

L’Europa è nata, in linea di principio, come Unione economica e come Unione politica, ma

se nel corso del tempo la prima prospettiva si è certamente realizzata – grazie, tra l’altro, alla

rimozione delle barriere doganali e, più in generale, di tutti quegli ostacoli che si frapponevano alla

libera circolazione delle persone, delle merci e dei capitali – la seconda ha finito col collocarsi

(meglio, coll’essere collocata) in una zona d’ombra.

Dire Unione politica significa, innanzitutto e implicitamente, attribuire una legittimazione

democratica alle istituzioni che quell’unità la compongono e la alimentano, ragion cui – alla luce

delle riflessioni che hanno animato lo studio finora condotto, e dunque in considerazione

dell’approfondimento del principio democratico e delle sue declinazioni nello spazio europeo – non

può mancare un riferimento al tema del c.d. deficit democratico dell’Unione europea 

In aggiunta a questo, gli elevanti livelli di astensionismo registrati nelle consultazioni

elettorali europee costituiscono di per sé una debolezza della democrazia rappresentativa europea,

su cui inficiano, altresì, l’alto numero di assenze dei parlamentari europei. #salvatorecirillosasa #unitiue","The unresolved question of the democratic deficit Europe was born, in principle, as an economic union and as a political union, but while over time the first prospect has certainly been realised — thanks, inter alia, to the removal of customs barriers and, more generally, all those obstacles to the free movement of persons, goods and capital — the second one has ended up positioning itself (better, by being placed) in a shadow zone. To say political union means, first and foremost, giving democratic legitimacy to the institutions that make up and nourishing that unity, so — in the light of the reflections that have inspired the study carried out so far, and therefore in view of the deepening of the democratic principle and its declines in the European area — a reference to the issue of the so-called democratic deficit of the European Union cannot be lacking. In addition to this, the high levels of abstentionism recorded in European electoral consultations constitute in itself a weakness of European representative democracy, on which also affect the high number of absences of MEPs. gid://decidim-dife/Decidim::Hashtag/3697/salvatorecirillosasa gid://decidim-dife/Decidim::Hashtag/3698/unitiue",The unresolved issue of the EU’s democratic deficit.,OtherIdeas,it,2,comment_129163,,"Salvatore, estoy totalmente de acuerdo con tu expresion:  ""una debilidad de la democracia representativa europea""

Sin embargo, el Reino Unido, país por el cual se incluyó el inglés como idioma oficial de la UE cuando ingresó, ha salido de la Unión. 

Una solución es dar ese estatus de lengua de trabajo a un idioma internacional, neutral, para que no haya predominio de un idioma nacional sobre los demás.

El esperanto es un idioma fonético, lógico y sin excepciones, y por tanto muy fácil de aprender, en mayor medida, para personas cultas y políglotas como son los funcionarios de la UE, y absolutamente para el cuerpo de traductores e intérpretes de la UE, a los cuales se les enseñaría en unos pocos meses.

Esto permitiría unas traducciones de mayor calidad al resto de idiomas de la unión, ya que el esperanto serviría de idioma puente.

One solution is to give that working language status to an international, neutral language, so that there is no predominance of one national language over others. Esperanto is a phonetic language, logical and without exception, and therefore very easy to learn, to a greater extent, for educated and polyglots such as EU officials, and absolutely for the EU’s body of translators and interpreters, who would be taught in a few months.

Das ein komplettes Verbot von etwas nicht funktioniert kann man am Beispiel der Prohibition in Amerika sehr gut sehen. Jemand der eine Waffe will (oder eben Alkohol wie im Beispiel) kommt an eine ran auch wenn es vom Staat her verboten ist. Dadurch wird es nur schwerer/unmöglich dies zu kontrollieren und in Grenzen zu halten.

Mein Vorschlag wäre es eine Mischung aus dem Amerikanischen und dem Japanischen Waffengesetz zu machen (nur im übertragenen sinne).

1. Waffen in Kategorien unterteilen (z.B. Pistolen, Repetiergewehr, Halbautomaten, usw.)

2. Wie in Japan Prüfungen, Kurse und Psychologischer Nachweis dass man

den Korrekten Umgang mit einer Waffe lernen und nachweisen muss (bisher kann man diese ja einfach Kaufen wenn man die Belege hat, ohne wirklich eine Aussage zu haben ob diese Person dazu auch geeignet ist). Diese Prüfungen sollte es pro Kategorie geben.

3. Wenn man alles nötige erfüllt hat und bestanden hat, darf man jede Waffe kaufen welche in die jeweilige Kategorie gehört, zu welcher man die Prüfungen, Kurse, Nachweise abgelegt hat.

4. Z.B. jährliche Kontrollen (Schiessnachweise, Lagerung, usw.).

Dadurch würde das Interesse am Schiesssport zurückkommen, wodurch sich für den Staat auch Profit aus diesen Kursen und Prüfungen schlagen lässt und man einen besseren Nachweis über die Vertrauenswürdigkeit des Waffenbesitzers hat.","Please keep on the head that I am not an expert, but only someone with an idea and a brief idea of implementation. A complete ban on something does not work well, using the example of prohibition in America. Someone who wants a weapon (or alcohol as in the example) comes from a crane even if it is banned by the state. This makes it difficult/impossible to control and limit this. My proposal would be a mixture of the American and Japanese arms laws (only in the transferred sense). 1. Divide weapons into categories (e.g. pistols, repeating guns, semi-automatic machines, etc.) 2. As in Japan, examinations, courses and psychological evidence that it is necessary to learn and prove the correct handling of a weapon (so far you can just buy it if you have the supporting documents without really having to say whether this person is suitable for this). These tests should exist per category. 3. Once you have met and passed everything you need, you can buy any weapon belonging to the category to which you have passed the tests, courses, certificates. 4. E.g. annual inspections (track records, storage, etc.). This would restore interest in skiing, allowing the State to profit from these courses and examinations and providing better evidence of the trustworthiness of the weapon owner.",Adaptation of American-Japanese weapons legislation,OtherIdeas,de,1,comment_752,,"Da keine Zeichen mehr übrig waren hier noch ein Kommentar:

- Anstieg des Interesse am Schiesssport

Nachteile:
- Hoher Administrativer Aufwand wenn Umgesetzt (Hier müsste man schauen wie man es am Besten machen würde damit noch Profit rausgeschlagen werden kann, aber wenn der Preis für diese ganzen Kurse/Prüfungen hoch wäre, würde es die meisten welche eine Waffe nur haben wollen damit sie eine Haben auch fernhalten)

Bedeutung der sog. „Renovierungswelle“ für die Erreichung der Klimaziele, begrüßen den Vorschlag zur Verbesserung der 

Informationen und von Anreizen zur Erhöhung der nationalen Renovierungsquoten und unterstützen Maßnahmen zur 

langfristigen Dekarbonisierung von Gebäuden ebenso wie eine europaweite Vergleichbarkeit der Energieeffizienz. 

Fortlaufende Überwachungs- und Berichtspflichten werden hingegen ebenso kritisch gesehen, wie starre 

Renovierungsquoten für Gebäude. Zusätzliche Bürokratie trägt weder zur Erreichung der Klimaziele bei, noch schafft sie 

dringend benötigten Wohnraum oder verbessert die finanziellen und organisatorischen Voraussetzungen der Kommunen. 

Die kommunale Ebene investiert von sich aus in die Modernisierung von Gebäuden, benötigt aber hierfür auch 

ausreichend flexible Regelungen, um einen guten Kosten-Nutzen-Faktor zu erzielen. Dies ist auch angesichts der 

angespannten Finanzlage der Kommunen aufgrund der Einnahmeausfälle durch die Coronavirus-Krise zwingend

Additional bureaucracy does not contribute to achieving climate targets, nor does it create much needed housing or improves the financial and organisational conditions of municipalities. The municipal level invests on its own initiative in the modernisation of buildings, but also needs sufficient flexibility to achieve a good cost-benefit factor. This is also necessary in view of the strained financial situation of municipalities due to the loss of revenue caused by the coronavirus crisis. The implementation of the Green Deal initiatives will be and will take place mainly at the local level. However, municipalities, cities, districts and districts cannot and cannot bear the costs of this transformation alone and need sufficient financial and organisational support without additional bureaucracy.
