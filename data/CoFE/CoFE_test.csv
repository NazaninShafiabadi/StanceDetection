These are investor schemes that allow non-EU citizens/residents to get an EU passport or residency visa in an EU Member State. 
With the EU citizenship, the new EU passport holder may travel, live and work in the EU, or even vote in certain elections. The investor residency schemes, in turn, lead to residency visas in a given EU country. While residency does not confer the same freedoms as the EU citizenship, it does give a person the right to reside in the EU country, and to travel freely in the Schengen area.
In three EU countries (Cyprus, Malta, and Bulgaria) it is possible to get citizenship in exchange for an investment, known as “golden passports”, while 19 EU countries operate investment programs for residency permits, or “golden visas”.

6073,Common EU asylum policy based on quotas and selectivity,"My proposal is based on the following principles:

1. The right to migrate to EU is not an universal human right. We, the EU nations, are not required to take in economic or even humanitarian migrants if it puts too high a burden on our welfare systems or social cohesion. 

2. Humanitarian migration must be based on common agreed quotas and prioritization.

3. The rights of member states to decide their own immigration policy must be respected. No state should be forced to process asylum applications or house asylum seekers against their will, but they could be required to financially support those that do.

4. There should be no freeloaders. Everyone should take part in sharing the burden. The responsibility for keeping out unwanted guests should not fall solely on the border nations, but at the same time, there needs to be incentives for them to keep the borders secure and ensure all incomers are properly registered. 

Keeping those in mind, I propose the following:

There should be a cap on how many asylum seekers are accepted each year or month. The cap should be based on common agreement among all members and adjusted annually. A quota is calculated per each country by dividing this cap per population and GDP. Then each state will decide their own quota of how many applicants they take. If less than their assigned quota, they will pay their share to other countries; if it is more, then they will be reimbursed the average costs by the aforementioned states.","My proposal is based on the following principles:

Es muss an den Anlaufpunkten der Außengrenzen wie Griechenland, Ungarn, Italien, Frankreich, aber auch an weniger frequentierten Routen massiv durch EU Gelder in Infrastrukturmaßnahmen investiert werden, die zum einen der lokalen Bevölkerung zugute kommen, zum Anderen den örtlichen Behörden in Zusammenhang mit EU-Behörden ermöglicht, die Menschen dort aufzufangen und menschenwürdig zu versorgen. 

Die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten müssen die ankommenden Menschen mit einem festen Schlüssel, entweder nach Bevölkerungsproporz oder Wirtschaftsleistung verteilen. Dafür sollte eine Behörde geschaffen werden, die sich ausschließlich mit der Logistik der Verteilung der Menschen beschäftigt, da die Organisation von 27 nationalen Behörden untereinander vorprogrammiert ist im Chaos zu enden, zumal Länder die sich quer stellen wollen hier Möglichkeiten haben in der Praxis zu torpedieren. 

Wer sich dem Schlüssel entziehen will sollte pro nicht aufgenommenem Geflüchteten die Versorgungskosten für mindestens die Dauer eines durchschnittlichen Asylverfahrens plus die Dauer eines durchschnittlichen Aufenthaltes in der EU an einen zentralen Fond zahlen, dessen Mittel an die aufnehmenden Länder zur Refinanzierung der Versorgung gezahlt werden.","The fact is that any failure to provide assistance is an unacceptable treatment of people and their fate for a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. There is a need for massive EU investment in infrastructure measures at the points of entry at the external borders, such as Greece, Hungary, Italy, France, but also on less frequent routes, which will benefit the local population on the one hand, and, on the other hand, local authorities in the context of EU authorities to capture and provide decent care to people there. EU Member States must distribute arrivals with a fixed key, either by population or economic performance. To this end, an authority should be set up to deal exclusively with the logistics of the distribution of people, as the organisation of 27 national authorities is to be pre-programmed among themselves in chaos, especially as countries that wish to face up to this can in practice have the possibility of torpeating. Those who want to avoid the key should pay the costs of care for at least the duration of an average asylum procedure plus the duration of an average stay in the EU to a central fund, whose funds are paid to the receiving countries to refinance the care, for each refugee who has not been admitted.","Recognition of reality and ideologically free, pragmatic problem-solving",Migration,de,25,comment_8174,,"Es sollte das Ziel der EU sein den Geflüchteten mitzuteilen, dass Sie ein Heimatland haben.

11518,Integrated photovoltaics in the fight against climate change and as an opportunity for a sustainable energy transition,"Integrated photovoltaics is already studied all over the world, but in my opinion the topics importance has not yet been recognised by politics. One example of integrated photovoltaics (PV) is Agrivoltaic, in which additional electricity is generated over agriculturally used land and a coupled yield of about 160% (80% electricity and 80% harvest) can be achieved. Other examples are photovoltaics integrated into traffic areas and floating photovoltaics on lakes.

As Europe's air improves due to less air pollution, the yield of PV systems increases. At the same time, the climate is changing, and Europe is getting warmer and drier. Consequently, it is essential to protect crops from sunburn and drought. Semi-transparent solar cells or normal ground-mounted systems with a certain degree of permeability could be a solution to guarantee agricultural yields even in dry years and at the same time generate green decentralised electricity for the respective region. Even in the areas of desertification (as in Spain and Eastern Europe), lake desiccation and rising temperatures in big cities, shady photovoltaic systems promise enormous potential for the future.

Unfortunately, such plants have hardly been promoted in Europe so far, as the double benefit is not taken into account in tenders.

Here new stimuli for industry, agriculture and research must be provided to promote these plants in Europe and profit from exporting our knowledge to the whole world.

Thank you very much!

SAFs are not made from fossil fuels, but from CO2 that has been taken out of the air recently, either by biological processes or through technology. Unlike offsetting schemes, SAFs leave no uncertainty whether the CO2 is ever recovered. When SAFs are used, the CO2 had to be captured before takeoff.

Currently, SAFs only make up 0.1% of the fuel used by airlines. As there is no incentive to buy SAFs and as fossil fuels are cheap, there is little demand and no mass production. This must change. 

To ramp up the production of SAFs, the EU should boost demand:

•	All flights booked for EU staff should be made instantly carbon neutral through SAF buying schemes such as Compensaid.

•	Airlines should have to buy SAFs. Initially, this should cover the first class cabins' share of fuel on each flight (with the cost passed on to the fare), then, in stages, business class, premium economy, until eventually it should apply to all bookings

•	All airlines operating in the EU should offer a voluntary SAF buying scheme similar to Compensaid in the booking process right away.

•	All business jet operators, cargo airlines, and air forces should have to buy a proportion of SAFs, increasing to the max possible amount of SAFs in stages.

•	All aircraft engines produced from 2035 onwards should be able to run on 100% SAFs.","The EU should accelerate the journey towards sustainable aviation by rapidly increasing the amount of sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) used in the aviation sector right now.

93523,Produzione di energia elettrica da pannelli fotovoltaici sopra le maggiori strade,"Buongiorno,

La mia idea è quella di produrre energia solare da pannelli solari trasparenti montati su strutture di metallo o di altri materiali sopra le principali arterie stradali, come autostrade e tangenziali. Di seguito riporto alcuni dati che ho provato ad elaborare per illustrarVi quanto potrebbe essere utile ed efficiente questa soluzione energetica.

Per quanto riguarda l'Italia, esistono 7000 km di autostrade, di larghezza minima di 10m (2 carreggiate più 1 corsia di emergenza).

Tot superficie minima = 70'000'000 m² 

Con un pannello solare di 1m²  si producono circa 200W per ogni ora di sole 

Wh prodotti in media per ogni giorno dell'anno a 11 ore (media) di luce al giorno su pannelli con efficienza energetica del 20% =

=154'000'000'000 Wh

=154'000'000 

Domanda di energia elettrica in Italia nel 2019 =319'622 GWh.

Ora, chiaramente non dico di ricoprire totalmente tutti questi kilometri, ma suppongo che solo una parte, nei tratti più agevoli e consoni per la costruzione e la manutenzione di queste infrastrutture, sarebbe estremamente utile per risolvere in modo efficace il problema di questo secolo: la grande domanda di energia da fonti che non mettano a repentaglio la salute e la sicurezza dell'uomo rovinando il pianeta. 

Questa è la mia proposta, spero che possa essere quantomeno presa in considerazione.

 Grazie dell'attenzione.

Minimum area = 70'000'000 m² With a 1 m² solar panel, approximately 200 W are produced per hour of sunshine Wh produced on average for each day of the year at 11 hours (average) of light per day on panels with energy efficiency of 20 % = =154'000'000 Wh = 154'000'000'000'000'000'000 demand for electricity in Italy in 2019 =319'622 GWh. Now, of course, I do not say that I cover all these kilometers completely, but I suppose that only a part, in the most convenient and appropriate sections for the construction and maintenance of these infrastructures, would be extremely useful in solving the problem of this century effectively: the great demand for energy from sources that do not endanger human health and safety by ruining the planet. This is my proposal, I hope that it can at least be taken into account. Thank you for your attention.

From France relying on its nuclear energy (accounting for 41.3 % of the structure of primary energy consumption in 2016 thanks to its dozens of nuclear power plants) to Romania, whose natural gas accounts for almost 30 % of the same structure (compared with only 9 % of nuclear power), the European Union needs common energy policies to support the production of renewable energy (and above all non-carbon energy such as nuclear energy during this transition) and an overall reduction in energy production in connection with a reduction in its environmental consumption. With regard to food security, the European Union needs to stop this export food production system as initiated in the middle of the twentieth century in order to favour the establishment of local networks of small farms (to foster food resilience), with a more natural multi-crop (non-use of pesticides + preference for permaculture) that is less destructive than the current agricultural model based on monoculture. Not only would this function be less destructive to the soil, but it would create jobs in the agricultural world, through the non-use of polluting mechanical appliances and pesticides of all kinds, and finally improved public health.","Energy and food, pillars of the ecological transition",GreenDeal,fr,5,comment_82468,,"I recommend splitting up your idea into 2 proposals, because nuclear power cannot be a part of a common European energy future, it's just way to expensive (and dangerous).

Solarthermal power plants in deserts are highly efficient (the sun shines 24/7, 365 days a year) and do not cover fertile soil. Furthermore, it is a great economic chance for developing countries. Another benefit is that these states could cover their own energy needs with those newly built, EU-supported power plants. Therefore, the EU would help them to achieve their climate goals faster. 

The effects of this would be green energy for all, tighter economic relations between the continents and faster fulfilment of the goals of the Paris Agreement.

So, finding new sources of earnings for these countries should be of great geopolitical interest to the EU.

3) This is a good point. All of this should go hand in hand. Parallel to exporting energy, MENA states can/should transform their energy systems (and economies), too. There is enough place in the desert for both: export and own use.

This puts a lot of pressure on EU firms and other actors which have to invest massive amounts of financial and non-financial (time, expertise acquisition, etc.) resources to respect rigid regulations.

Regenerative agriculture is well established, both scientifically & practically. It's easy to establish. No decision for organic farming is required at first place.

Darum müssen wir alle Bereiche in denen wir CO2 ausstoßen, vom Verkehr über die Industrie bis zur Landwirtschaft überdenken. Das haben wir, davon bin ich überzeugt, verstanden. Nur die Antworten auf den menschgemachten Klimawandel können nicht nur immer schärfere Ziele sein, sondern müssen Pläne und Investitionen sein,wir diese Ziele auch gut und sicher erreichen. Die USA können schon heute milliardenschwere Pakete zur Transformation ihrer Gesellschaft auflegen. Warum können wir das nicht? Der sog. Green Deal ist ein schöner Anfang, aber weder ausreichend noch zielgetreu. Wir müssen mehr tun und nicht nur in Worten und Zielen sondern in bürgernahen Taten. Muss der ÖPNV teuer sein? Muss die Transformation zu regenerativen Energien langsam und kontinuierlich verlaufen? Können wir nicht mehr tun?

Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz schließen sich nicht aus und sie müssen in Zukunft symbiotisch zusammenleben. Wenn die Politik den Weg dahin nicht ebnet, wird es kein wirtschaftlich starkes Europa in der Zukunft geben. 

800 Mrd. Euro über das geplante hinaus für aktiven Klimaschutz bis 2030:

- 300 Mrd. für eine erfolgreiche Mobilitätswende, die Arbeitsplätze in Europa erhält, möglicherweise weitere schafft

- 300 Mrd. für starke Anreize für einen sauberen Energiesektor

- GAP muss Ökologie in den Mittelpunkt stellen

This is why we need to rethink all areas where we emit CO2, from transport to industry and agriculture. I am convinced that that is what we understood. Only the responses to human climate change can not only be ever more ambitious goals, but must be plans and investments, and we must achieve them well and safely. The US can already put in place billions of millions of packages to transform its society. Why cannot we do so? The Green Deal is a beautiful beginning, but neither sufficient nor faithful to its objectives. We need to do more, not only in words and goals, but in actions close to citizens. Must LPT be expensive? Does the transformation into renewable energies have to be slow and continuous? Can we not do anymore? The economy and climate protection are not excluded and they will have to live together symbiotically in the future.

I personally also would favor the concept of regenerative agriculture, because its a framework of clearly defined practices & outcomes. It does focus on soil health, water retention capacity, soil carbon content, biodiversity etc. This means that improvements are measurable & clearly defined.

Regenerative agriculture transforms farms into resilient ecosystems with an abundance of nutrient rich products.

These features are necessary to survive in future.

It contains almost all forest societies of the Northern Limestone Alps in good shape, notable is the very high proportion of the Carbonat mountain mixed forest (Fi-Ta-Bu-Bah) of about 65 km² (“Bergmischwald-NLP”). The total forest share is 64 %, the remaining 36 % are the Krummholzzone, alpine lawns and rocky areas as well as subalpine alpine pastures. The NLP contains three mountain lakes, spring bogs, spring runs, gump-rich torrents with partly high waterfalls and a total of 20 km of translocation routes of alpine rivers. In addition, there are two castles of Bavaria King Ludwig II valuable in terms of architecture: Linderhof and Neuschwanstein. Via the Tyrolean mountain massif of the vulture heads and, if necessary, the Plansee with mountain environment, a trans-national mountain national park Germany/Austria would be possible.

Zusätzlich sind Biomassekraftwerke von CO2-Steuern befreit.  Während Solar-, Wind-, Geothermie- und Wasserkraftanlagen kein CO2 erzeugen wird von Biomassekraftwerken viel davon emittiert. Früher hat man Kohle verbrannt, jetzt setzt man auf Biomasse und Holz. Bei jeder Art von Verbrennung werden jedoch  große Mengen CO2 in die Athmosphäre geblasen, pro 1 Tonne Holz oder Pellets sind das 2 Tonnen CO2. Die Politik benennt diese klimaschädliche Verbrennung ""Naturwärme"". Und weil die Bäume ja wieder nachwachsen wird das auch noch als ""klimaneutral"" bezeichnet. Dass das bei der Biomasse-Verbrennung freigesetzte CO2 sofort in die Athmosphäre gelangt, der nachwachsende Wald aber Jahrzehnte benötigt, um dieses wieder aus der Athmosphäre zu absorbieren, diese Zeitdifferenz wird ignoriert.  Biomasse-Verbrennung ist eine veraltete, klimaschädliche  Technologie.

In addition, biomass power plants are exempt from CO2 taxes. While solar, wind, geothermal and hydro power plants do not produce CO2, much of it is emitted by biomass power plants. You used to burn coal, now you're relying on biomass and wood. However, with each type of incineration large amounts of CO2 are blown into the atmosphere, which is 2 tons of CO2 per 1 ton of wood or pellets. Politics call this climate-damaging combustion “natural heat”. And because the trees regrow again this is also called “climate neutral”. The fact that the CO2 released during the biomass combustion immediately enters the athmosphere, but the renewable forest takes decades to absorb it again from the athmosphere, this time difference is ignored. Biomass combustion is an outdated, climate-damaging technology. In the case of transport, one wants to move away from combustion engines, with biomass power plants one wants to promote biomass combustion, how does this fit together? Combustion is an outdated, CO2-intensive technology that is no longer to be forced and promoted and whose CO2 emissions have to be priced, including biomass power plants.

I propose the E.U introduce Carbon-footprint labelling that converts the carbon impact of manufactured goods into a simple overall score based on a scale of 5 colours and letters (A is green to represent the best carbon footprint grade while E is dark orange to show it's the lowest).

The aim would be to legislate Carbon-footprint labelling across all E.U member states, including all goods imported into the E.U.

The objective is to empower the consumer to make better-informed decisions when purchasing goods and their overall impact on the environment. 

The labelling would be similar to natural labelling commonly displayed on food and beverages. 

The labelling places pressure on manufacturers to rethink how they source, assemble, manufacture and distribute goods - empowering consumers to purchase more sustainable goods.

Manufacturers could leverage carbon offsetting if they balance carbon dioxide emissions with its removal or by eliminating emissions from society, such as planting trees.  

An E.U Oversight Team at the European Commission could be established to monitor, enforce, and inspect labelling accuracy.

Lt Weltklimarat werden p.a.

3. Herstellung von Portland Zement muss optimiert werden.

LT Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will release billion CO2 per annum for the production of cement (i.e. up to 10 % of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. ) 98 % of the CO2 emissions in concrete come from cement production.

Ceci vient de loin : la disparition des lignes directes longue distance (Paris Berlin) et des trains de nuit (Paris Rome), le démantèlement des liaisons transfrontalières et inversement, l’explosion du transport routier et du transport aérien low cost. La route pèse plus de 80% du transport passagers, et de 75% du transport intérieur de marchandises mais 70% des émissions du secteur transports ! 

Le train pourtant est très économe (1,9% de la consommation d’énergie des transports) et génère très peu de gaz à effet de serre (0,4% des émissions  du secteur.) Pour inverser les évolutions très négatives de ces dernières décennies, et atteindre la neutralité carbone d’ici 2050 (c’est le « Pacte Vert »), la décarbonisation des transports, responsable d’un quart des émissions de gaz à effet de serre, est une grande priorité : il faut réduire les émissions de 90 % d’ici à 2050.

Il existe une vieille promesse de mobilité de tous (Interrail) et des jeunes (DiscoverEU) à travers l’Europe et au-delà. Osons la vision d’un espace ferroviaire vraiment européanisé. Supprimons les liaisons aériennes en dessous de 400 kms. Facilitons l’accès des voyageurs avec des billets à prix abordable et des billetteries uniques entre réseaux. Restaurons les trains de nuit, le fret ferroviaire et les liaisons entre villes et capitales. européennes.

This comes from afar: the disappearance of long-distance direct lines (Paris Berlin) and night trains (Paris Rome), the dismantling of cross-border links and vice versa, the explosion of road transport and low cost air transport. The road accounts for more than 80 % of passenger transport, and 75 % of inland freight transport, but 70 % of emissions from the transport sector! However, the train is very efficient (1.9 % of transport energy consumption) and generates very few greenhouse gases (0.4 % of the sector’s emissions). To reverse the very negative developments of recent decades and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 (the Green Pact), the decarbonisation of transport, responsible for a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, is a high priority: emissions must be reduced by 90 % by 2050. There is an old promise of mobility for all (Interrail) and young people (DiscoverEU) across Europe and beyond. Let us dare to see a truly Europeanised railway area.

elettrica provoca la scomposizione dell'ossido di ferro, lasciando il ferro puro di cui c'è bisogno per l'acciaio e l'ossigeno puro come sottoprodotto. Non si produce parallelamente CO2 come invece avviene nel processo tradizionale in altoforno. 

Questa tecnologia a mio avviso andrebbe importata e incentivata anche in Europa, in quanto per ogni tonnellata di acciaio prodotto con il metodo tradizionale, si sviluppano 1,8 tonnellate di CO2. Una enormità, tenendo conto che la previsione del quantitativo di acciaio che verrà prodotto nel 2050 sarà di 2,8 gigaton/anno = circa 5,0 gigaton di CO2/anno.","The steel production process developed by the American company Boston Metal (through the so-called molten oxide electrolysis) instead of combining iron with blast furnace coke, uses electric current.

CO2 is not produced in parallel, as is the case in the traditional blast furnace process. In my view, this technology should also be imported and encouraged in Europe, as for each tonne of steel produced using the traditional method, 1.8 tonnes of CO2 are developed.

12314,Reutilización de vehículos mediante la electrificación disminuyendo la burocracia,"Europa quiere reemplazar la flota de vehículos existente de diesel y gasolina, por vehículos eléctricos.  Para ello se presupone que éstos son un desecho. Muchos cumplen perfectamente su función a no ser por las emisiones.  Ya es posible electrificar los vehículos, pero las exigencias burocráticas hacen que resulte demasiado caro sin necesidad.  Por ejemplo cada vez que una persona presenta un proyecto para cambiar un vehículo, otro usuario con el mismo vehículo y mismas características no puede aprovecharlo abaratando los costes, debe presentar otro proyecto y pagar por él aunque sea exactamente el mismo. Y luego deben pagar la homologación cuando lo que hacen es un reforma. Aprovechar los millones de vehículos que hay ayudaría doblemente a reducir las emisiones.  Y abaratarlo es posible si una vez que se ha presentado un proyecto los usuarios venideros pueden utilizarlo (y pasar la revisión donde se comprueba que se ha hecho de esa forma) con garantías, reusando un vehículo que de otro modo sería un deshecho y dando trabajo a talleres con esa transformación.","Europe wants to replace the existing diesel and petrol car fleet with electric vehicles.

They must then pay for approval when they do what they do is a reform. Harnessing the millions of vehicles that exist would help to reduce emissions twice.

Our dependency on rather shady multinationals has destroyed the faith of many Europeans in the use of vaccines. Unwillingness to vaccinate has never been as high as today. Why? Because the companies that produce them are just doing it for the money. To make things worse: Many of these vaccines were developed with huge government subsidies, but after development these were sold back to us! So that's a double profit for the manufacturers and a double loss for the rest of us ...

It doesn't have to be that way though, if we take a lesson from history:

No one knows the 'root' cause of Diabetes Type 2.

A strong hypothesis is that artificial Transfats in processed foods is the most likely root cause of Diabetes Type 2 because of its additional hydrogen atom and trans molecular structure v normal fat structure of cis shape. Transfats inhibit the normal function of insulin receptors which leads to build up of high blood sugar in the blood and cause Diabetes Type 2.

No one knows the 'root' cause of Alzheimer's Disease.

A strong hypothesis is that artificial Transfats in processed foods is the most likely root cause of Alzheimer's Disease because of its additional hydrogen atom and trans molecular structure v normal fat structure of cis shape. Transfats accumulation in brain cells prevent the normal cleave (cut) of Amyloid precursor protein in the cell membrane which leads to toxic offcuts and buildup of plaque resulting in destruction of brain cells, voids in the brain and loss of memory and brain function.

Work to validate above hypotheses by software modelling is ongoing.

Leider auch sehr stark in die Wissenschaft, die sich gerade zu dem Thema paradox gespalten präsentiert. Und dies obwohl es faktenbasiert doch nur eine einzige Wahrheit gibt.

Es kann und darf nicht sein, dass sich vielfach die Wissenschaftsbereiche darüber beklagen müssen, dass ihre Ergebnisse nicht oder nicht ausreichend in die Entscheidungen der Politik einfließen.

Es kann und darf nicht sein, dass ausgerechnet Wissenschaftler vielfach gesicherte Erkenntnisse durch Wahrscheinlichkeiten, ungesicherte Annahmen oder Hörensagen ersetzen. 

Vor allem nicht einseitig - wenn also auf der einen Seite gesichertes Wissen und Verifizierung verlangt wird (Präventions-, Heil- und Linderungsmaßnahmen), auf der anderen Seite aber Wahrscheinlichkeiten, Annahmen und Hörensagen reichen, um darauf weitere Schritte aufzubauen (Impfungen). Dies obwohl der Unterschied zwischen Medikamenten für Kranke und Impfungen für Gesunde das Gegenteil gebietet.

Die Politik ist der Bevölkerung, die ja als mündige Bürgerschaft maßgebliche Entscheidungen mit weitreichenden Folgen zu treffen hat, bezüglich der ganzen und tatsächlichen Wahrheit in der Pflicht.

It cannot and must not be the case that the scientific fields often have to complain that their results are not or not sufficiently reflected in policy decisions. It cannot and must not be the case that scientists often substitute reliable knowledge with probabilities, uncertain assumptions or listening points. Above all, if, on the one hand, there is a requirement for secure knowledge and verification (preventive, curative and remedial measures), but on the other hand, there are probabilities, assumptions and audiences sufficient to build up further steps (vaccination). This is despite the fact that the difference between medicines for sick people and vaccinations for healthy people calls for the opposite.

For instance, refreshing for tetanus is usually recommended every 10 years; however, after 20 years of no refreshing (I forgot), blood tests showed I still have antibodies. EU Member States should agree to recognise the relevant WHO standards and the national document certifying the level of antibodies (or vaccine/refreshment).

1813,Tisztességtelen burkolt áremelések a kereskedelemben,"A kereskedelemben általánosan tapasztalható burkolt áremelésekre szeretném felhívni a figyelmüket. Szeretném, ha foglalkoznának ezzel a témával.

Az elmúlt időszakban jelentősen emelkedtek az árak. És nem három-négy százalékkal, mint ahogy azt a hazug statisztikákban mondják.

Általánosan tapasztalható jelenség, hogy egyre csökken az árucikkek beltartalma, tömege. Például a 2 kilós száraz macskaeledel mostanra már csak 1,4 kilogrammot nyom. A 200 grammos Negro, már csak 159 gramm, ráadásul a cukorszemek mérete is soványabb kisebb lett, hogy ne legyen feltűnő a darabszám drasztikus csökkenése. A hiány elfedésére, még az egyre üresebb tasakokat is felfújják levegővel.

Ebben az évben már többször előfordult a boltokban, hogy dupla árakba futottunk bele. A burkolt áremelések csak irritálják az embereket. Példaképpen nézzük meg egy konkrét termék árváltozását:

Gyümölcs ízű White Snack tavaly tavasszal 99 forint volt egy csomaggal, most 129 forintba kerül. Ráadásul csökkent a tömege is, tavaly 100 gramm volt, most már csak 60 gramm. Csak számolással deríthető ki, hogy mennyi a tényleges áremelés:

129 : 99 = 1,3  vagyis egy csomag termék ára 30 százalékkal nőtt.

100 : 60 = 1,667   de mivel 40 százalékkal csökkent a tömege, ezért 66,7 százalékos burkolt áremelés is történt.

1,667 x 129 = 215 forint lenne egy csomag ára most, ha még mindig 100 gramm lenne a tasakban.

215 : 99 = 2,17   vagyis a tényleges áremelés 117 százalék, több mint a duplájára nőtt a termék ára egy év alatt.","I would like to draw your attention to hidden price increases in trade in general. I would like to address this issue. Prices have increased significantly over the past period. And not by three to four per cent, as is stated in the Hungarian statistics. There is a widespread tendency to reduce the content and weight of articles. For example, dry cat food of 2 kilos is now only 1.4 kg. Negro, 200 grams, is now only 159 grams, and the size of the sugar beans has become more lean, so that the drastic reduction in the number of pieces is not noticeable. To cover the deficit, even more empty bags are inflated with air. This year, we had several times in shops to run into double prices. Hidden price increases only irritate people. By way of example, see the price change of a specific product: With a fruity taste, White Snack was HUF 99 129 with a package last spring, and is now costing HUF 129. In addition, its weight decreased from 100 grams last year to only 60 grams. Only by calculation can the actual price increase be ascertained: SECTION 129: 99 = 1,3, i.e. the price of a package product increased by 30 per cent. SECTION 100: 60 = 1,667 but as its weight decreased by 40 per cent, a surreptitious price increase of 66,7 % took place. 1.667 x 129 = HUF 215 would be the price of a package now if it were still 100 grams in the bag. SECTION 215: 99 = 2.17, i.e. the actual price increase is 117 per cent, more than doubling the price of the product over a year.",Unfair surreptitious price increases in trade,Economy,hu,1,comment_2720,,"Az áremelésen és a vásárlók becsapásán túl, még a környezetet is jobban károsítják.

67324,"Eliminating DST - The Easiest Way to Increase Productivity and Income, Save Energy, Reduce Health Expenditure, and Making Europe Greener","Europe must be without time changes and with geographically appropriate time zones, as that is making its citizens, and respective nations, poorer.

“Daylight saving time” (DST), the practice of moving clocks forward 1 hour and forcing schedules to take place 1h earlier, reduces the health and well-being of people, especially when instituted permanently, because biologically we do not adapt to this artificial change.

However, it is often stated that there are benefits to DST that should be considered, especially ones related with the economy. The data available shows exactly the opposite:

-One concern, expressed in parliamentary debates, is that a patchwork of time zones within the EU will affect trade. Applying a single time zone is estimated to increase trade by only ca. 0.001 – 0.005% of total trade per hour difference.

-The loss in productivity due to DST reduces “Gross Domestic Product” (GDP) in percentage points (>1%), with a reduction of salaries.

-The costs in health expenditure increase as well due to premature death, sickness, and accidents, reducing GDP further anywhere between 0.1 - 1.0%.

-It is also claimed that DST significantly saves energy, especially electricity. However, that also is not the case. DST’s impact on electricity consumption is now believed to be around 0, while fuel consumption is increased. This in turn also contributes to an increase in pollution.

Therefore, for an actual fairer, healthier, and stronger economy, all DST practices must end.","Europe must be without time changes and with geographically appropriate time zones, as that is making its citizens, and respective nations, poorer.

High enough: provide for a decent standard of living, which meets society’s social and cultural standards in the country concerned; prevent material poverty and provide the opportunity to a full participate in society. Net amount of UBI should be at least above the at-risk-of-poverty level according to EU standards (60% of the national median net equivalent income).

Secondly because we have plenty of common goods to regulate and preserve. Our societies have needs that bullshit jobs do not fulfill. These needs (common goods) must be collectively and democratically determined.

134,Protecting our savings and economy: Completing the Banking Union,"Following the last debt crisis in Europe, the Banking Union was established to integrate the Union’s financial sector and make it more resilient to future shocks. The Banking Union has instruments to monitor the condition of banks and support their restructuring to limit the impact of individual failures on the broader financial system. 

However, the Banking Union is still missing its third pillar, a European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS), which would allow the whole Union to guarantee bank deposits up to a certain amount. Without this instrument in place, the EU remains vulnerable to future crises because a single country may not be able to guarantee the deposits of its banks. If a bank goes bankrupt, the deposits it held are lost, causing collateral damage to the whole financial system surrounding it because people and companies cannot get their money back. This, in turn, can cause a ‘domino effect’ of bank insolvencies across Europe and another economic crisis. 

The Banking Union should be completed without delay by introducing EDIS that would replace national insurance schemes. This will create a robust pan-European guarantee that EU bank deposits (including our personal savings) are not lost during crises, regardless of the member state each bank is located in. Achieving this is especially important now, as we are expecting a new economic downturn following the COVID-19 pandemic.","Following the last debt crisis in Europe, the Banking Union was established to integrate the Union’s financial sector and make it more resilient to future shocks.

Mit der vollständigen Beseitigung aller bilateralen Investitionsabkommen mit EU-Mitgliedstaaten (Intra-EU-BITs) fallen die Schutzwirkungen dieser völkerrechtlichen Abkommen weg. Gleichzeitig bestehen eklatante Probleme in Fragen der Rechtsstaatlichkeit und Rechtssicherheit in zahlreichen Ländern Mittel- und Osteuropas fort. Das Unionsrecht weist hier keine dem ISDS-Mechanismus vergleichbaren Schutzstandards auf und bietet speziell hinsichtlich des Schutzes vor ungerechtfertigter Enteignung keine Möglichkeit einer raschen, außergerichtlichen Streitbeilegung.

Es muss daher auf EU-Ebene ein neues, rechtlich verbindliches Schutzsystem für Investoren geschaffen werden. Dieses soll für alle Investoren aus EU-Mitgliedstaaten - auch für KMU - gut und ungehindert zugänglich sein und eine rasche rechtliche Abhandlung von Investorenproblemen sicherstellen. Vorstellbar sind die Einrichtung einer eigenen Investitionskammer beim Gerichtshof der EU, ein Ombudsmann-System oder die Schaffung eines an das SOLVIT-Verfahren angelehnten Systems.","The European Court of Justice has declared the internal investor-state arbitration tribunals (ISDS) in breach of EU law. The full elimination of all bilateral investment agreements with EU Member States (Intra-EU-BITs) eliminates the protective effects of these international agreements. At the same time, flagrant problems persist in the rule of law and legal certainty in many Central and Eastern European countries. Union law does not have any standards of protection comparable to the ISDS mechanism and offers no possibility of rapid, out-of-court settlement, especially with regard to protection against unjustified expropriation. A new legally binding system of protection for investors must therefore be established at EU level. This should be well and unhindered for all investors from EU Member States, including SMEs, and ensure that investors’ problems are dealt with quickly.

Az effajta helikopterpénz-szórás teljesen eltorzította, megnyomorította a hagyományos, normális gazdálkodást, mert a nagyurak rárepültek a táskaszám osztott pénzekre. Megszereztek szinte minden zsebkendőnyi földterületet, több ezer hektáros nagybirtokok jöttek létre. Emiatt eltűnt a hagyományos kisgazdaságok több mint 80 százaléka, szántók, mezők, legelők és erdők nélkül haldoklik a vidék, elnéptelenednek a falvak.

A nagyurak, ha nem csinálnának semmit a földjeiken, akkor is euró milliárdokat zsebelnek be minden évben. A nagyüzemi gazdálkodás is elment a valós igényeket kiszolgáló élelmiszertermelés felől, a biodízel alapanyagtermelés felé. Leggyakrabban repce-, napraforgó- és kukoricatáblák láthatók. Az élelmiszertermelésből kivont területek miatt egyre magasabbak az élelmiszerárak, fokozódik a nép nyomora.

Vezessenek be vagyonkorlátot! Csak a ténylegesen rászoruló TERMELŐKET támogassák a közösből! Szűrjék ki az álnevek mögé bújó csalókat.","One third of the budget of the European Union is paid to those who are already stone-rich. The system of agricultural subsidies should be redesigned because it is very distorted and unfair. More money is spent on the richest Europeans: agricultural bars, oligarchs, kingles, mafia groups, warlords and criminal organisations imprisoning power from all countries. The payment limit of EUR 100 has already been attempted, but it is being circumvented by free-finders, involving family members, friends and stróms. This sort of helicopter money dispersion completely distorted and pushed the traditional, normal management, as the greaturs raided money on the number of bags distributed. Almost all handkerchiefs were acquired, and large estates of thousands of hectares were created. As a result, more than 80 % of traditional small farms have disappeared, without arable land, meadows, pastures and forests, the countryside dies, and villages are depopulated. Even if they don't do anything on their lands, the grand lorry will incur billions of euros every year. Large-scale farming has also saved itself from the production of food serving real needs, towards the production of biodiesel raw materials. Rapeseed, sunflower and maize fields are most commonly visible. As a result of the abandonment of food production, food prices are increasing and the depression of the people is increasing. Introduce an asset limit! Only those producers who are genuinely in need should be supported from their commons!

112,Bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen,"Um in ganz Europa sicherzustellen, dass jeder Mensch ein selbstbestimmtes Leben in Würde führen kann und um die Armut endgültig zu beseitigen soll jeder Mitgliedsstaat der europäischen Union ein Konzept für ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen ausarbeiten, dass jedem Bürger ausgezahlt wird.

Das Grundeinkommen muss eine existenzsichernde Höhe aufweisen, die selbstverständlich zwischen den einzelnen Staaten variieren kann.

Es muss ohne Pflicht zu einer Gegenleistung wie z.B. Arbeit und ohne Bedürftigkeitsprüfung ausgezahlt werden.                                                     Es muss als monatlicher Geldbetrag und nicht z.B. in Form von Gutscheinen Individuen, nicht Haushalten, zur Verfügung stehen.

Prinzipiell soll jeder Bürger den Anspruch auf ein Grundeinkommen haben, jedoch können Altersabhängig unterschiedliche Beträge ausgezahlt werden. So können z.B. Kinder unter 14 Jahren 400€, Jugendliche über 14 Jahren 600€ und Erwachsene 1000€ pro Monat erhalten. Das Grundeinkommen von Inhaftierten Personen kann für die Zeit der Inhaftierung als Teildeckung der Haftkosten verwendet werden. Zur erleichterten Finanzierung des Grundeinkommens können die Kosten einiger bestehender Sozialleistungen wie z.B. Arbeitslosengeld, Rente und Kindergeld in das Grundeinkommen fließen. Sollte sich ein Staat der europäischen Union entschließen, die Rente beizubehalten, so kann das Grundeinkommen vollständig mit dieser verrechnet werden und für Personen im Rentenalter als eine Grundrente dienen.","In order to ensure that everyone can live an independent life in dignity throughout Europe, and in order to definitively eradicate poverty, each Member State of the European Union should develop a concept of an unconditional basic income to be paid to every citizen. Basic income must have a living level which, of course, may vary from one country to another. It must be paid without any obligation to pay consideration such as work or means-tested. It must be available as a monthly amount of money and not, for example, in the form of vouchers for individuals, not households. In principle, every citizen should be entitled to a basic income, but different amounts can be paid according to age. For example, children under the age of 14 can receive EUR 400, young people over the age of EUR 14 600 and adults EUR 1000 per month. The basic income of detainees may be used as partial cover of detention costs for the period of detention. In order to facilitate the financing of basic income, the costs of some existing social benefits, such as unemployment benefits, pensions and child benefits, may be included in the basic income. If a Member State of the European Union decides to maintain the pension, the basic income may be fully offset against it and serve as a basic pension for persons of pensionable age.",Unconditional Basic Income,Economy,de,77,comment_1492,,"Ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen hat keine Akzeptanz bei vielen Menschen, die für ihr Einkommen hart arbeiten müssen.

83293,Il faut mutualiser les emprunts des Etats de la zone euro pour les aider à financer leur déficit public et donc leurs projets de développement.,"Actuellement, pour financer leur déficit budgétaire, les Etats membres de la zone euro doivent s'endetter eux-mêmes sur les marchés et subir la loi des agences de notation et donc des taux d'intérêt différents. Les Etats les plus faibles économiquement, sont pénalisés pour financer leurs projets.

Le Plan de Relance européen vient de réaliser une première étape : émettre sur les marchés un emprunt européen de 390 milliards d'euros au bénéfice des Etats membres (sous forme de subventions donc pas de remboursements). Il faut s'appuyer sur cet exemple pour aller encore plus loin.

Il faudrait créer un nouvel organisme européen, appelé ici ""Agence Euro Trésor"" (AET) basée à Bruxelles ou au Luxembourg, qui servirait d'intermédiaire entre les 19 pays et les marchés financiers. Cette Agence recenserait chaque année les besoins de financement des Etats (dans une certaine limite, 3% du PIB ?) et émettrait des obligations européennes libellées en euros pour le même montant.Les sommes collectées seraient versées aux Etats, qui à leur tour, plus tard, rembourseraient l'AET (avec intérêts). Puis l'AET rembourserait les prêteurs.

Le gain est évident : un taux d'intérêt avantageux, unique et commun aux 19 pays, la notation de l'UE étant excellente.

Cette réforme nécessiterait quelques changements institutionnels dans la zone euro et dans chaque pays, mais elle serait profitable au bon fonctionnement des économies et permettrait d'éviter les crises de financement des Etats.","At present, in order to finance their budget deficit, euro area Member States must themselves debt to the markets and be subject to the law of credit rating agencies and therefore different interest rates. The economically weaker states are penalised for financing their projects. The European Recovery Plan has just completed a first step: issue on the markets a European loan of EUR 390 billion for the benefit of the Member States (in the form of grants, therefore no repayments). We need to build on this example to go even further. A new European body, called the Euro Treasury Agency (ETA) based in Brussels or Luxembourg, should be set up to act as an intermediary between the 19 countries and the financial markets. The Agency would identify each year the financing needs of the Member States (within a certain limit, 3 % of GDP?) and would issue European bonds denominated in euro for the same amount.The sums collected would be paid to the States, which in turn would, in turn, repay the ELA (with interest). Then the AET would reimburse the lenders. The gain is obvious: an attractive, unique and common interest rate for the 19 countries, with the EU rating being excellent. This reform would require some institutional changes in the euro area and in each country, but it would be beneficial to the smooth functioning of the economies and would help to avoid state funding crises.",We need to pool the borrowings of euro area countries to help them finance their public deficits and thus their development projects.,Economy,fr,1,comment_86296,,"Mutualiser les emprunts des Etats de la zone euro, une proposition de bon sens et même d'évidence si l'on considère l'UE comme une zone de solidarité (et d'intérêts communs) comme l'imaginaient les pères fondateurs.

This is why my idea would be to set up a contact point in each country to ask for the rules for cross-border workers and find help with public authorities, as the institutions too are not familiar with it, thus creating major problems when they need care or retire. However, it would also be an institution where the relevant authority can also ask for rules in another country in order to make it easier for citizens to obtain a benefit without having to fight for it.",A contact point for citizens and institutions to clarify cross-border issues,Economy,de,1,comment_92698,,"Derart hilfreiche Stellen gibt es in Grenzregionen:  Meiner Kenntnis nach im Saarland und der Region Aachen:

Zur Absicherung der Finanzierungsfähigkeit schlage ich vor die Steuerpflicht an die Staatsangehörigkeit zu binden (vgl. USA) wodurch eine Steuerflucht unterbunden wird. 

Besteuern würde ich dabei Vermögen, bzw. Einkünfte aus vermögen. Dazu habe ich vor kurzem gelesen, dass das gesamte private Vermögen in Deutschland sich auf 6 Billionen Euro beläuft und von diesen 6 Billionen hat das oberste Dezil (oberen 10%) einen Anteil von 64% (Quelle ist der Paritätische Wohlfahrtsverband) Die Zahlen dürften für den Rest Europas in vergleichbaren Dimensionen liegen. 

Damit könnte man schon allein in Deutschland den gesamten Bundeshaushalt finanzieren und hätte noch viel Luft nach oben, und man könnte dazu noch das Grundeinkommen finanzieren. 

Finanziell ist es also ohne weiteres möglich und die Reichen werden dadurch nicht mal arm. 

Dafür könnte man auf Steuern auf Arbeit verzichten. 

Das wird notwendig weil durch die Digitalisierung je nach Schätzung 30% bis 60% der Arbeitsplätze wegfallen werden und das in den nächsten 10 bis 15 Jahren. 

Dadurch würde der Mensch frei werden um sinnvoller Arbeit nachzugehen. Dabei muss man beachten, dass Lohnarbeit nur eine Untermenge von Arbeit ist. 

z.B. Ehrenamtliche Arbeit ist auch eine Arbeit die sozial einen Mehrwert hat, aber nicht vergütet wird.

Dadurch wird das soziale Leben aufgewertet.","I propose a uniform basic income throughout Europe, financed by a European tax. In order to ensure eligibility for financing, I propose to make tax liability subject to nationality (cf. US), which prevents tax evasion. In doing so, I would tax assets and/or income from assets. I have recently read that total private wealth in Germany amounts to EUR 6 trillion, of which the top 6 trillion (top 10 %) has a share of 64 % (source of the Joint Welfare Association) The figures for the rest of Europe are likely to be similar. In Germany alone, it would be possible to finance the entire federal budget and would have a lot of upward air and could also finance the basic income. This means that it is easily possible to make it financially possible, so that the rich are not even poor. In order to do so, taxes on labour could be waived. This will be necessary because digitalisation will eliminate between 30 % and 60 % of jobs, depending on estimates, and this will take place in the next 10 to 15 years.

However, there is a bigger problem. For those who have lived, worked and paid contributions in more than two European countries, their pension is very complicated, being spread over several Member States.

I propose the creation of a pension system managed at European level that would be voluntary, yes, but in any case an option for any European who has paid contributions in more than two Member States.

However, there is a bigger problem. For those who have lived, worked and paid contributions in more than two European countries, their pension is very complicated, being spread over several Member States.

Come dimostra il Gender Equality Index, infatti, la situazione per le donne a livello lavorativo è ancora estremamente inferiore rispetto a quella maschile in diversi Paesi europei. Ad esempio, tra i 25 e i 39 anni (età in cui le donne hanno di solito una gravidanza) le donne impegnate a tempo pieno in Italia sono solo il 50,8% del totale, contro al 60,8% in Europa.

As the Gender Equality Index shows, in fact, the situation for women at work is still far lower than that of men in several European countries.

Its implementation would need obviously lots of other basic aspects of everyday life to be adapted, however there are lots of models, very well discussed even when unfortunately no serious field experiments could have been done up to today.

Moreover, sex workers suffered a lot during lockdown because, unlike people working in restaurants or in cinemas, they carry a social stigma for which many of them may feel unconfortable to declare their occupation and ask financial help.

I think that if prostitution were legalized, it would be necessary to educate people to the idea that prostitution is just a job like many others. A woman should be free to sell her body for money without being judged negatively for that: she is not hurting anybody afterall. Also, if people started to consider prostitutes like any other employee they will treat them more respectfully, making their job less dangerous. Moreover, it would be easier for a sex worker to change job, if they don't like it: nowaday I think many people might bear prejudice regarding hiring an ex-prostitute, and that is not right, because they are not criminal.

896,Index Sociale gelijkheid van levenskwaliteit in Europa,"Sociale gelijkheid wordt nu meestal gelijkgesteld aan gelijke salariëring of gelijke koopkracht, enz. De verschillen tussen de verschillende landen en regio’s in Europa zijn groot en hebben te maken met culturele, geografische, klimatologische en historische verschillen. Het is erg moeilijk dit op Europees niveau te bereiken, alhoewel er een streven moet zijn in die richting. 

Belangrijker is echter dat mensen een goede levenskwaliteit ervaren. Een basis materiële welvaart blijft nodig, maar gezondheid, woonomgeving, onderwijs, cultuur, sociale contacten, enz. zijn belangrijk. 

Ik stel voor dat men meetmethoden (sommige zijn reeds ontwikkeld) gebruikt en een index of een beperkt aantal indices ontwikkelt. Hieruit moet een doelstelling komen om meer gelijkheid op deze basis te bekomen in de verschillende Europese regio’s (niet landen want binnen landen zijn er ook grote verschillen). Regelmatige communicatie hierover zal mensen doen beseffen dat ze niet steeds jaloers moeten zijn op hogere gesalarieerden, maar dat ze mogelijk beter scoren op andere waardenschalen en deze koesteren.","Social equality is now usually equated with equal pay or purchasing power, etc. The differences between the different countries and regions in Europe are large and are linked to cultural, geographical, climatic and historical differences. It is very difficult to achieve this at European level, although there should be an effort to do so. More importantly, however, people experience a good quality of life. Basic material prosperity remains necessary, but health, housing, education, culture, social contacts, etc. are important.

Le président Macron s’est prononcé pour l’autonomie stratégique européenne. Très bien !

La France n'a donc pas d'autres choix que de nouer des alliances car son budget est limité. L'Institut Montaigne estime qu'il faudrait coordonner les plans de relance entre Etats membres afin d'éviter d'alimenter des "" filières nationales surcapacitaires et redondantes "".

Que faire ?

En matière opérationnel, il faut se coordonner avec nos alliés. Par exemple, la France a un seul porte-avions, qui ne peut être à la mer en permanence pour cause de maintenance. 

Or l’Italie a des porte-aéronefs, le Cavour et bientôt le Trieste (qui entrera en service en 2022), qui sont adaptés pour embarquer des avions de combat furtifs américains F-35 B. Ils peuvent donner corps à une force aéronavale européenne avec les Rafale du porte-avions Charles de Gaulle. Coordonnons les pour qu’une « flotte » de porte-avions européens soit en permanence à la mer pour défendre nos intérêts et être présente là où sont les enjeux européens. L'Allemagne pourrait apporter en soutien ses destroyers et sous-marins, le Benelux ses navires antimines, la Suède ses frégates, etc

Enfin l'UE doit aider les pays démocratiques de son voisinage comme l'Ukraine menacée à l'est en en mer noire par la Russie : aide financière, logistique, avec le soutien américain, décisif. 

La paix à l'est, c'est la paix chez nous aussi. Ne les oublions pas !","How can we tackle Europe’s military and strategic challenges? President Macron spoke in favour of European strategic autonomy.

Things to do In operational terms, we need to coordinate with our allies. For example, France has a single aircraft carrier, which cannot be at sea at all times because of maintenance. However, Italy has aircraft carriers, the Cavour and soon the Trieste (which will enter into service in 2022), which are adapted to take on board US F-35 B. F- B. They can give shape to a European aerial force with the Rafales of the Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier. Let us coordinate them to ensure that a “fleet” of European aircraft carriers is permanently in the sea to defend our interests and be present where European issues are at stake. Germany could provide support for its destroyers and submarines, Benelux, anti-mine vessels, Sweden, etc. Finally, the EU must help democratic countries in its neighbourhood such as Ukraine threatened to the east by Russia in the black sea: financial and logistical assistance, with US support, decisive.

Since it cannot be assumed that such changes to the underlying treaties will be accepted by all Member States, only the EU’s self-resolution remains. This should be prepared by the development of new treaties and structures that allow countries wishing to integrate into a new community of states immediately after the dissolution of the old EU, without the paralysing shortcomings of the old EU. States of the old EU which are too far away from the task of state sovereignty in favour of the Community may come together, if necessary, in another association, similar to the old EU. The transition of such states into the certainly more effective new EU remains untapped — but now under the conditions laid down by the new Treaties.

Europa!,"Beim Europa-Forum Wachau wurden über einen Zeitraum von einem Jahr europäische Themen mit Bürgern und Bürgerinnen in diversen Formaten diskutiert und wissenschaftlich durch die Donau-Universität Krems begleitet. Eine der Hauptforderungen der Bürger und Bürgerinnen Europas war:  Heimat? Das ist Europa.

Heimat ist dort, wo man sich nicht erklären muss. Damit sich ein Heimatgefühl in Bezug auf Europa entwickeln kann, muss sich Europa also stärker den Bedürfnissen der regional  stark  divergierenden  Bedürfnisse  der Menschen zuwenden. So wie sich der Trend  zur  Regionalisierung  als  Ergänzung  zur  zunehmenden  Globalisierung  entwickelt hat, so hat sich auch das das politische Konzept des „Europa der Regionen“ und  die  Einberufung  des  „Europäischen  Ausschusses der Regionen“ (AdR) im Jahr 1994  als  Komplementär  zu  Zentralisierungstendenzen  der  Europäischen  Union  herausgebildet. Die europäische Union nä-her an die Menschen heranzubringen und Ihnen  damit  das  Zugehörigkeitsgefühl  zur  EU zu stärken, ist erklärtes Ziel des AdR.","At the Wachau Europe Forum, over a period of one year, European issues were discussed with citizens in various formats and scientifically accompanied by the Danube University of Krems. One of the main demands of European citizens was: Home? That is Europe. Home where you don't have to explain. This means that, in order to develop a sense of home about Europe, Europe needs to focus more on the needs of people’s very diverse needs at regional level. As the trend towards regionalisation has evolved as a complement to increasing globalisation, the political concept of “Europe of the Regions” and the convening of the “European Committee of the Regions” (CoR) in 1994 as a complementary partner to the centralisation trends of the European Union have emerged. Bringing the European Union closer to people, thus strengthening your sense of belonging to the EU, is the CoR’s declared objective.",Home?

Dans ce cadre, il serait intéressant que les états communiquent entre eux à une échelle individuelle uniquement pour les débats intra-européens. Mais lorsqu'il s'agit de communiquer ou d'agir en dehors de l'UE, ce fait devrait relever d'un acte européen.

La notion d'armée européenne et de diplomatie européenne est à mon avis fondamentale si l'UE souhaite avoir sa place et son influence au sein du monde d'aujourd'hui.

A ce titre on sait déjà que chaque pays excelle dans certains domaines militaires, chacun pourrait apporter sa pierre à l'édifice que serait une armée commune.

1998,Centers of excellence in Science and Education,"Through science we can build a better world by 2030. A better world  means improving people’s lives, and safeguard the planet for future generations 

At the present time research in Europe is scattered all over the continent. Example: how many different universities, research labs, science institutions are doing research on cancer, artificial intelligence, climate change, Alzheimer ….?   

I think resources would be more effectively used if we create centers of excellence in Europe where we pull the resources together, focused on some specific topic. 

These centers of excellence could attract the best scientists in their area of expertise working together and getting quicker and better results. 

We should also improve the quality of our universities and our education system in general. Why are the best universities to-day in the USA? Why are nobel prize winners in medecine and science often Americans (and relatively few in Europe)?

Also our schools should improve in quality to ensure that all youth should be given the opportunities to become scientists, engineers and mathematicians. 

Furthermore, immigrants, the unemployed, the handicapped and people that already have a job should receive education and training so that they can grow in competences and thus fully participate in the job market.","Through science we can build a better world by 2030.

13895,Kann die Vision einer Weltregierung Realität werden?,"Hallo EUROPA,

die meisten Landesregierungen haben große , vielseitige Probleme. Diese Demokratie beruht auf veralteten Ansichten und Festlegungen. Die Zukunft ist schneller. Internet, Digitalisierung verändert schnell die Welt.

Als erster Schritt sollte der Einfluss von Länderregierungen abgebaut und dafür das Europäische Parlament mit viel mehr Kompetenz ausgebaut werden. Aus EU-Sicht könnten alle Landesregierungen zu einer Europäischen Regierung verschmelzen. Leider sind wir noch zu weit davon entfernt.

Allerdings könnte eine einheitliche Europäische Regierung immer noch nicht die zukünftigen, großen Herausforderungen auf dieser zu kleinen Erde, mit immer mehr Menschen, alleine lösen.

Wie wäre es mit der VISION einer Weltregierung für alle Menschen. Könnten so die zukünftigen, großen Aufgaben Best möglichst gelöst werden? Aufgaben gibt es genug, die von einzelnen Ländern nicht mehr alleine gelöst werden können. Beispiele sind:

Klimawandel

Kriegsverhinderung

Konzentration auf das Wesentliche

Ernährungsversorgung für alle Lebewesen

Gesundheitsversorgung für alle Lebewesen

Wasserversorgung für alle

Flüchtlingsproblematik

Endende Rohstoffe

Abschaffung von Einzelinteressen zugunsten des Gesamtwohles.

und vieles mehr.

Was halten Sie von der VISION einer sinnvollen Weltregierung in 300 Jahren?","Hallo EUROPA, most of the national governments have major, multifaceted problems. This democracy is based on outdated views and definitions. The future is faster. Internet, digitalisation is rapidly changing the world. As a first step, the influence of national governments should be reduced and the European Parliament strengthened with much more competence. From an EU perspective, all national governments could merge into a European government. Unfortunately, we are still too far from this. However, a single European government would still not be able to solve the major future challenges on this too small earth alone, with an increasing number of people. How would VISION be a world government for all. Could the major future tasks be dealt with as much as possible? There are enough tasks that can no longer be solved by individual countries alone. Examples are: Climate change prevention of war focusing on the essential food supply for all living beings Health care for all living beings Water supply for all refugee issues Removal of individual interests in favour of overall livelihoods and much more.

L’ONU a sacralisé  la souveraineté des Etats. Seule l’Union Européenne incarne leur nécessaire dépassement. Dans le contexte d’interdépendance intense et irréversible entre les sociétés il est urgent de faire émerger la conscience d’une communauté mondiale de destin, par la prise de conscience que ce qui nous unit aux autres sociétés est plus important que ce qui nous oppose. Cela ne peut  se faire qu’en organisant un dialogue direct entre les sociétés, sur un pied d’égalité, impliquant tous les milieux sociaux et invitant les uns et les autres à confronter leurs regards sur des défis communs mondiaux. 

L’expérience du forum China-Europa (www.China-Europa-Forum.net) montre qu’un tel dialogue est possible, enthousiasmant et révèle que sur bien des sujets les divergences au sein de la société européenne et au sein de la société chinoise sont  supérieures aux divergences entre «  Chinois » et  « Européens ».

This can only be done by organising a direct dialogue between societies, on an equal footing, involving all social circles and inviting each other to confront their views on common global challenges. The experience of the China-Europa Forum (www.China-Europa-Forum.net) shows that such dialogue is possible, exciting and reveals that on many topics differences within European society and within Chinese society are greater than the differences between “Chinese” and “Europeans”.

333,European Common Defence and Security Alliance,"At present, the EU relies on NATO (and by virtue, the United States) for its defence but, as recent events have shown, the USA is an increasingly reluctant custodian of peace in Europe and can swing from interventionist to isolationist with each change in administration. NATO also facilitates US hegemony over Europe and complicates any future possible cooperation with Russia.

The idea of an EU army is currently neither feasible nor desirable. We cannot have an EU army without an EU state, which probably will not come into existence in our lifetimes.

That is why we need to revisit the idea of a defence union that is independent of NATO, with the goal of coordinating the security and defence of the Union whilst respecting the sovereignty of its member states. It should focus on the standardisation of equipment, vehicles, aircraft, military technology and strategy across the EU. The desired goal of this standardisation would be that the only difference in terms of equipment between the Finnish and Bulgarian armies, for example, is the flags painted on the side of their tanks.

This alliance should institutionalise the PESCO and the CSDP policies and be a distinct arm of the EU, on the same level as the Single Market. It would save member states a fortune in defence spending and promote further European unity and integration by showing Europeans fighting side by side (rather than against each other) with the same equipment and visual identity.","At present, the EU relies on NATO (and by virtue, the United States) for its defence but, as recent events have shown, the USA is an increasingly reluctant custodian of peace in Europe and can swing from interventionist to isolationist with each change in administration.

Focusing on internal matters at this given time is more pressing. Recovering from the effects of the pandemic and creating jobs will help tackle the far right sentiment which was on the rise in Europe hindering further integration in all sectors, including the CSDP.
That being said, the current status quo serves us also good. The US under Biden is a much more reliable ally than under Trump in matters of European defense giving us time to get on our feet first.

2516, Gesetzliche Regelung der Nichteinmischung in die inneren Angelegenheiten anderer Staaten durch den EU-Rat und das EU-Parlament,"Schaffung eines Gesetzes, dass es einem jeden Mitgliedsland und der EU als Ganzem verbietet, seine eigenen Wertvorstellungen einem anderen Land aufzuzwingen. Es ist das alleinige Recht eines jeden Landes innerhalb und außerhalb der EU, seine eigene Entwicklung zu bestimmen.

Begründung

Unsere eigenen Wertvorstellungen haben sich im Laufe der Geschichte vielfach und teils mit heftigen Umbrüchen verändert und werden sich auch in Zukunft ändern. Was wir heute als moralisch richtig ansehen, kann und wird in der Zukunft dem Wandel unterliegen. Uns fehlt die Legitimation, unsere momentanen Wertvorstellungen anderen Ländern aufzuzwingen und ihre politische Entwicklung zu lenken.

Darüber hinaus wandelt sich die vormals verbale Einmischung in die inneren Angelegenheiten anderer Staaten in den heutigen Zeiten schwindenden wirtschaftlichen Einflusses der EU in Wettbewerbs- und Handelshemmnisse. Statt des freien Wettbewerbs zwischen den Ländern um die erfolgreichste wirtschaftliche und kulturelle Weiterentwicklung treten ideologische Vorwürfe und eine mit diesen Vorwürfen begründete Diskriminierung der Beziehungen. Das scheint mir unvereinbar mit unseren Wertvorstellungen zu sein.","The creation of a law prohibiting each Member State and the EU as a whole from imposing its own values on another country. It is the sole right of each country within and outside the EU to determine its own development. Our own values have changed many times over the course of history and will continue to change in the future. What we consider morally right today can and will be subject to change in the future. We lack the legitimacy to impose our current values on other countries and to guide their political development. In addition, the former verbal interference in the internal affairs of other states in today’s times is changing the economic influence of the EU into barriers to competition and trade. Instead of free competition between countries for the most successful economic and cultural development, ideological accusations and discrimination in relations based on these allegations arise.

Das Europäische Parlament hat zu wenig Kompetenz. Die anstehenden Probleme wie Klimaveränderung, Kriege, Flüchtlingsproblematik, Zukunftsfähigkeit kann von einem Erdteil nicht gelöst werden.

Deswegen rate ich dazu eine hochkompetente Weltregierung neu zu gründen und dafür das Europäische Parlament aufzulösen.

Die Erde besteht aus 195 Ländern. Deswegen reicht eine kompetente Weltregierung mit 1000 Weltdemokraten aus. Jedes Land erhält je nach Landesgröße und Einwohnerzahl unterschiedlich viele Weltdemokraten. Die Amtszeit beträgt 5 Jahre. Nur 1 Wiederwahl ist möglich. Die 1000 Weltdemokraten wählen ihren Präsidenten.

Die Weltsprache ist Englisch. Diese 1000 Weltdemokraten sind mit schnellstem Internet jederzeit miteinander verbunden. Das Monatseinkommen beträgt 50 000.- Euro und ist für alle 1000 Weltdemokraten gleich, auch für den Präsidenten. Jegliche Nebeneinnahme ist verboten und wird mit einer lebenslangen Haftstrafe geahndet.

Zielsetzungen sind:

Glaubensgemeinschaften zu vereinen.

Kriege auszuschließen.

Klimaveränderung zu stoppen.

Flüchtlingsproblematik zu lösen.

Wasserversorgung sicher zu stellen.

Ernährungsversorgung sicher zu stellen.

Gesundheitswesen zu vereinheitlichen.

Bildungssysteme zu vereinheitlichen.

Gemeinwohl geht vor Länderinteressen.

Erhaltung der Tierwelt.

Erhaltung der Natur.

Weltwährung einführen.

Keine Weltverschuldung .

Weltgericht.

Wie denken Sie darüber? Welche Punkte sollten zusätzlich verankert werden?","Hello Europa, your opinion is asked. The European Parliament has too little competence. The challenges ahead, such as climate change, wars, refugee issues and sustainability, cannot be solved by one part of the world. That is why I would like to relaunch a highly competent global government and to dissolve the European Parliament. The Earth is made up of 195 countries. This is why a competent global government with 1000 World Democrats is sufficient. Each country receives different numbers of world democrats depending on its size and population. The term of office shall be 5 years. Only 1 may be re-elected. The 1000 World Democrats elect their President. The world language is English. These 1000 World Democrats are connected to each other at all times with the fastest internet. The monthly income is EUR 50 000 and is the same for all 1000 World Democrats, including the President. Any incidental use is prohibited and is punishable by life imprisonment. The objectives are: To unite religious communities. To exclude wars. To halt climate change. To resolve the issue of refugees. Water supply. Food security. To harmonise health care. Unifying education systems. The common good takes precedence over the interests of the Länder. Conservation of wildlife. Nature conservation.

Con questa rinnovata consapevolezza, si rende necessaria una linea comune in materia di politica estera. La frammentazione politica ha infatti portato ad una tacita e colposa indifferenza rispetto a problematiche internazionali; tale inazione è poco coerente con i valori che l’UE promuove. 

Pur potendo contare sul ruolo dell’Alto Rappresentante per gli affari esteri e la politica di sicurezza, le ristrette prerogative affidategli limitano la credibilità dell’UE come soggetto politico internazionale, già compromessa dalla mancanza di un indirizzo politico condiviso. Non variando le modalità di elezione dell’Alto Rappresentante, gli si attribuirebbe la facoltà di prendere decisioni senza ricevere l’approvazione del Consiglio, essendosi previamente consultato con esso. Questi dovrebbe affiancare il Presidente del Consiglio europeo nel  ruolo di portavoce dell’UE all’ONU. Si propone inoltre che diventi l’interlocutore privilegiato del Presidente del Comitato militare: a questo fine si rende necessario l’efficientamento delle forze militari, che dovrebbero essere accorpate in un unico ente. Infine, qualora il suo operato (orientato al benessere dell’UE tutta, premurandosi di non ledere gli interessi dei singoli stati membri) venisse giudicato non congruo al ruolo che ricopre, il Consiglio potrebbe proporre una mozione di sfiducia, da sottoporre all’approvazione del Parlamento.","The pandemic has highlighted the need for greater cohesion in tackling shared problems.

He should support the President of the European Council in his role as the EU’s spokesperson at the UN.

However, the IMPLEMENTATION of those EU values is under enormous strain, as all western democracies are.  I am not going to lecture you on policy, I am going to suggest a number of ACTIONS for the EU Commission to take in order to avoid being swept along on the mudslide of populism.

1.  EU Commissioners (and other highly paid officials) must take an immediate pay cut of 20% for six months, or 10% for one year.  Jacinda Ardern took a pay cut in NZ.  This matters.

2.  Get out more.  Use the money you have saved to take food parcels out to the most deprived communities in the EU.  Help poor people. You don't need super vans with EU logos to do this.  Think of this as wartime.  If you don't, it soon will be.  As a child brought up on Catholic charity I remember the huge gratitude I felt when a parcel of clothes came and I knew our house was safe, with a low rent.

3.  Get out of Strasbourg.  NOW.  Still there?  Are you kidding?  Do what Pope Francis has done and turn one great EU property over to the homeless.

There hasn’t been an EU enlargement since Croatia joined the Union in 2013, despite the progress made by several candidate and potential candidate countries to meet the membership criteria. This creates a divide between those who can enjoy the freedoms and opportunities the Union provides and those who are dependent on only limited forms of integration. While some countries put great effort into meeting the accession criteria, their EU integration has been arbitrarily blocked by individual member states, often based on narrowly-defined national interests or domestic pressure from nationalistic groups.

China hat sich in den letzten Jahren für manche überraschend als ein Rivale der westlich-abendländischen Zivilisation gemausert. China war über gut 2000 Jahre die bestimmende Zivilisation in Asien; sie war damit das, was Rom über vielleicht 500 Jahre in Europa war. Daher kam die Überlegenheit Europas, die sich durch Aufklärung, Wissenschaftlichkeit und technologische Entwicklung einstellte, für China komplett überraschend. Es reichten dem britischen Reich wenige militärische Mittel, um dieses riesige Reich im 19. Jahrhundert in die Knie zu zwingen. Diese Niederlage wurde als schwerste, nie zu vergessende Schmach empfunden. Daher ist die jetzige, offen ausgedrückte Strategie der Regierung, den angestammten Platz in der Geschichte als führende Zivilisation zurückzugewinnen, nur eine logische Konsequenz aus dem chinesischen Selbstverständnis. 

Wir Europäer dürfen uns keinen Illusionen hingeben. Wir neigen aus unserer politischen Geschichte heraus dazu, eine gewisse Gegnerschaft des Volkes gegen die herrschende Klasse, wenigstens aber einen kritischen Abstand als selbstverständlich anzunehmen. Diese Tradition aber ist in China fremd. Das Volk ist mit der Regierung weitgehend einig, und dies umso mehr, wenn das Ausland auch nur die harmloseste Kritik an irgendetwas in China äußert. Selbst eine demokratische Revolution wird über noch Jahrzehnte keinen wahren Internationalismus anstreben.","China: my wife is Chinese and I speak some Chinese. In recent years, China has surprised some as a rival of Western Western civilisation. China has been the dominant civilisation in Asia for over 2000 years; it was what Rome has been in Europe for perhaps 500 years. Therefore, the superiority of Europe, which came to light through enlightenment, scientificity and technological development, came as a surprise to China. Few military means were enough for the British Empire to bring this huge empire to its knees in the 19th century. This defeat was felt to be the most severe, never-forgotten reproach. Therefore, the government’s current, frankly expressed strategy to regain the ancestral place in history as a leading civilisation is only a logical consequence of the Chinese self-conception. We Europeans must not give ourselves any illusions. From our political history we tend to take for granted a certain opposition of the people against the ruling class, but at least a critical distance. But this tradition is foreign in China. The people are largely in agreement with the government, and this is all the more so if foreign countries express even the most harmless criticism of anything in China.

In my opinion, closed houses should be reopened, protected by the state or organised in cooperatives of free association of women: they would have more protection and security, health checks, the payment of pension contributions, etc. It would be better than the crap and the bad deal that’s going on today!.

2.- La maternidad es un plus en el desarrollo personal y profesional de la mujer. 

3.- La crianza en el apego fortalece la relación entre la madre y el niño ayudando a la estabilidad emocional de ambos. La dedicación exclusiva- temporal o permanente- a la familia, favorece el desarrollo de los niños y la estabilidad familiar tan necesaria para una sociedad próspera, y no puede seguir siendo infravalorada.

4.- La maternidad debe contar con el necesario apoyo social y político. 

5.- Se deben poner los medios sociales, económicos y políticos necesarios para lograr que 

	La maternidad no sea motivo de discriminación laboral 

	La maternidad y la dedicación a la familia no suponga discriminación o pérdida de reconocimiento social

	No sea motivo de enfermedad o muerte

	No suponga un freno en la vida profesional o reducción de salaride salario, si no es por elección propia de reducción de jornada

	No sea forzada ni motivo de pérdida efectiva de libertad dentro del ámbito de la familia

	No sea objeto de alquiler o compra-venta

Les procès pour inaction climatique à l’encontre des Etats ou des grandes entreprises n’ont pu faire valoir l’impact de cette inaction sur l’ensemble des sociétés et sur le climat ; ils ont dû mettre en avant l’impact... sur les droits humains des communautés nationales. Et on attribue une personnalité juridique à des rivières pour pouvoir  leur conférer des « droits ». 

La prééminence des droits humains est propre à l’Occident. Dans un monde qu’il dominait encore  ils se sont affirmés en 1948 comme valeur universelle mais on n’en trouve pas l’équivalent dans d’autres civilisations et leur caractère exclusif a rompu l’équilibre entre droits et responsabilités. La seule valeur vraiment universelle est la responsabilité car elle fonde l’idée même de communauté,  souvent composée d’humains et de non humains, dont chaque membre doit rendre compte de l’impact de ses actes sur l’ensemble de la communauté.

In a world he still dominated, they asserted themselves in 1948 as a universal value, but it is not the equivalent in other civilisations and their exclusive character has broken the balance between rights and responsibilities. The only truly universal value is responsibility because it underpins the very idea of a community, often made up of humans and non-humans, of which each member must account for the impact of its actions on the whole community. Responsibility will be the backbone of ethics and law in the 21st century. This will require the adoption of a Universal Declaration of Human Responsibilities during the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Dignity and integrity of the human embryo must be respected.

To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities which presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid and public health.

In 2013, 1.7 million European citizens called through a European Citizens' Initiative - ONE OF US - for the respect of the human embryo in EU policies. ONE OF US has demanded that the EU stop funding research that involves the destruction of human embryos. ONE OF US has requested that EU humanitarian aid operations in third countries not include funding for abortions. 

We are those citizens mobilised with ONE OF US. We are 1.7 million citizens, a figure never equaled for a European Citizens' Initiative. This makes ONE OF US the most successful mobilisation since the creation of this participatory democracy tool set up to allow citizens to get involved in the EU's construction.

To ensure consistency in areas of its competence where the life of the human embryo is at stake, the EU should prohibit, and end funding for activities which presuppose the destruction of human embryos, in particular in the areas of research, development aid and public health.

In 2013, 1.7 million European citizens called through a European Citizens' Initiative - ONE OF US - for the respect of the human embryo in EU policies. ONE OF US has demanded that the EU stop funding research that involves the destruction of human embryos. ONE OF US has requested that EU humanitarian aid operations in third countries not include funding for abortions. 

We are those citizens mobilised with ONE OF US. We are 1.7 million citizens, a figure never equaled for a European Citizens' Initiative. This makes ONE OF US the most successful mobilisation since the creation of this participatory democracy tool set up to allow citizens to get involved in the EU's construction.

We reiterate our demand to the EU to recognise the protection of all human life as a value of Europe.

Ref. Titel: Polizei und Militär im Jahre 2050. Gewährleistung von Interoperabilität, Austauschbarkeit und Resilienz durch duale Rollenwahrnehmung. 

Derzeit sind innerhalb der Europäischen Union (EU) geschätzt ca. 3 Millionen Soldat:innen,  Polizist:innen sowie zivile Arbeitnehmer:innen in unterschiedlichen Verwendungen bei Polizei  oder Militär tätig. 

Gemäß Ref. soll die EU Bevölkerung im Jahre 2050 durchschnittlich 48 Jahre alt sein. 

Damit Polizei und Militär ihre Aufgaben resilient, interoperabel und austauschbar bis 2050, trotz reduziertem Personal, robust und souverän meistern kann, muss sie folgende Aspekte bereits heute umsetzen:

1.) Einheitliche Ausrüstung 

2.) Einheitliche Einsatzgrundsätze

3.) Einheitliche Ausbildungsstandarts

4.) Einheitliche Befehlssprache

Kernelement ist eine einheitliche Ausrüstung, damit sich alles andere harmonisch entwickeln kann. 

Das geht nur durch Vorgaben, welche Ausrüstung für ein bestimmtes Problem genutzt werden darf. 

Darin liegt das Kernproblem, weil jede EU-Nation gerne ihre eigenen Firmen und Arbeitskräfte dafür nutzen möchten. 

Das ist aber auch vollkommen in Ordnung. 

Lösung:

Firmen, deren Lösungen durch ein supranationales EU Gremium (Beschaffungbehörde) zur Schließung einer bestimmten Fähigkeitslücke für gut befunden wurden, teilen know how, damit diese durch zugelassene Firmen gefertigt werden können. 

Das muss gesetzlich verankert werden und Firmen müssen zustimmen. 

Danke.","Ref.: cofe-PROP-2021-04-1030 Ref. Title: Police and military in 2050. Ensure interoperability, interchangeability and resilience through dual roles. There are currently an estimated 3 million soldiers in the European Union (EU): women, police officers and civilian workers: working in different situations in the police or the military. According to Ref., the EU population is expected to be on average 48 years old in 2050. In order for the police and the military to be able to cope with their tasks in a resilient, interoperable and interchangeable manner by 2050, in spite of reduced staff, they must already implement the following aspects: 1.) Uniform Equipment 2.) Uniform Operating Principles 3.) Uniform Training Standard 4.) Uniform command language Core element is a unified equipment to allow anything else to develop harmoniously. This can only be done by stipulating which equipment can be used for a particular problem. This is the key problem because each EU nation would like to use its own companies and workers to do so. But that is also perfectly correct. Solution: Firms whose solutions have been found to be good by a supranational EU body (procurement authority) to address a specific capability shortfall share know how to be produced by licensed firms.

In minor operations, the EU can delegate decision-making to an individual Member State, or a coalition of ready, willing and able countries. This is what happened in the evacuation in Afghanistan. The EU/NATO requested assistance from the Member States, which were able to make decisions fast and act swiftly.
Second, the defensive capabilities of a threatened Member State can be reinforced by men, money and machines from the EU.

37423,A Right to be forgotten for cancer survivors: a necessary step to avoid financial discrimination when accessing financial services in Europe,"Being a European cancer survivor in 2021 means experiencing and having to overcome personal and societal obstacles such as financial discrimination when seeking access to services such as mortgages and insurances.

The so-called Right to be Forgotten for cancer survivors marks a turning point, empowering cancer patients and promoting social rights. It was first recognised in France when the country established a law applying to cancer survivors seeking mortgages, loans, and life insurance.

This ground-breaking legal provision – which has now also been adopted by the Benelux countries – states that no medical information relating to the cancer disease can be taken into account by insurers when there is no evidence of relapse 10 years after the end of the treatments. 

The growing need for a European solution has now seen the European Commission address the Right to be Forgotten through its initiatives such as the Beating Cancer plan and the Cancer Mission.

EU cancer survivors need equal access to this legal framework. Such a step forward is crucial when clinical progress has led to more than 20 million EU citizens now recognised as cancer survivors.

The Conference on the Future of Europe represents a unique opportunity to speak up and collect stories of discrimination experienced by former cancer patients. Such activity should contribute to the debate, lead to improving cancer survivorship policies and promoting the Right to be forgotten for all EU Cancer survivors.","Being a European cancer survivor in 2021 means experiencing and having to overcome personal and societal obstacles such as financial discrimination when seeking access to services such as mortgages and insurances.

99200,Suomen lastensuojelu ja perheoikeus täytyy uudistaa radikaalisti. Ennakoiva + kaksi kotia. Rahoitusmalli palkitsee huostaanotoista ja lakia rikotaan.,"Suomen lastensuojelu tuottaa syrjäytyneitä isättömiä nuoria.

Osa pienistä kunnista onnistuu, mutta suuret kuten Espoo, Turku ja Oulu rikkovat lakia, perheiden ja lasten ihmisoikeuksia. Ne rikkovat autoritäärisin laein mm. YK:n lasten sopimusta, Euroopan Neuvoston lauselmaa 2079 perheen rikkomattomuudesta. Sopimuksia kahdesta vanhemmasta + 2 kodista ei noudateta lastensuojelussa.

Myös oikeuslaitos rikkoo EIT-päätöksiä - lapsen vieraannuttaminen (manipulointi) ja se ettei ikää saa tällöin painottaa. Lastensuojelulakia ja  uutta 2019 huolto- ja tapaamislakia ei noudateta. Äidit jotka vievät  riitaisina  huoltajuuden oikeuteen voittavat 85-87% tapauksista. Naistuomarit syrjivät ja isien avainnäyttöjä ei oteta oikeuskäsittelyihin ja päätösperusteluihin. Valvonta ei toimi. Ministeriöt peittelevät syrjintää.



Korruptiota voi olla osassa kuntia lastensuojelun ja ostopalveluorganisaatioiden kesken. Huostaanotot ovat 1.5 mrd euron kasvubusiness. Ala on 2-3 kertaistunut. 

Me järjestöt näemme  kasvavaa isyyden sukupuolisyrjintää ja miten viranomaiset kirjaavat Effica ja Kanta-terveysasiakirjoihin tahallaan vääriä tietoja. Naisvirkamiehet pelaavat voitot suosikeille.

Kansalaisjärjestöt EU:lle:

- Suomi tarkkailuun 

- vieraannuttaminen on henkistä väkivaltaa 

- tasavertainen 50-50 vuoroasuminen tulee taata + se suojaa lapsia syrjäytymiseltä

- isien syrjintä pois ja vieraannutusvapaa lapsijärjestelmä 

- oikeus ja lastensuojelu tulee korjata 

- ennakoiva hoito ja lastensuojelu 2 kotiin","Finnish Child Protection produces marginalised fatherless young people. Some small municipalities succeed, but large ones like Espoo, Turku and Oulu violate the law, the human rights of families and children. They violate, for example, the UN Children’s Convention, the Council of Europe’s resolution of 2079 on the inviolability of the family by authoritarian laws. Contracts for two parents + 2 homes are not respected in child protection. The judiciary also violates EIT decisions – alienation of the child (manipulation) and the fact that age should not be emphasised. The Child Welfare Act and the new 2019 Maintenance and Meeting Act are not complied with. Mothers who take custody to court in disputes win 85-87 % of the cases. Female judges discriminate and fathers’ key evidence is not included in court proceedings and decision-making grounds. Surveillance doesn't work. Ministries are covering up discrimination. Corruption can occur in some municipalities between child protection and purchasing organisations. Taking care is a EUR 1.5 billion increase in business. It’s 2-3 times. We organisations see growing gender discrimination in paternity and how authorities deliberately record false information in the Effica and Kanta health documents. Female officials play wins for favorites.

But the 400+ million EU citizens could easily afford it all.

So what about this: keep the national armies, but integrate the air forces and navies (and pay for them) at the EU level. Let individual ships & squadrons keep their national traditions. But also let any EU citizen join. (If the next naval genius on the scale of Nelson or De Ruyter happens to be Slovakian, then we'll never know, because there's no navy for them to serve in.) The EU navy & air force can then have volunteer rapid reaction forces of Marines and Paratroopers (and the Legion Etranger as a special case) for smaller-scale missions outside the EU.

The national armies can keep their unit traditions. Soldiers fight for their homes and their comrades, not for big ideals like 'the European project'.

Das Gründungsziel der EU war innereuropäischer Frieden.

Dem sollten sich Werte u.a. unterordnen.

Zu den Realitäten gehören unterschiedliche Wahrnehmungen der Welt und Unterschiede bei: Was ist richtig und gut und was ist böse und schlecht?

Dies wurde sehr deutlich beim Konflikt zwischen Deutschland und Griechenland bei Finanz- u Verschuldungskrise: Viele Deutschen verlangten von den Griechen, dass sie ähnlich werden wie die Deutschen und eine ähnliche Staatsführung haben wie in Deutschland und eine ähnlich Ablehnung von überbordender Verschuldung.

Die Griechen wehrten sich dagegen und hatten kein Problem damit, ihren eigenen Staat um die Steuern zu betrügen. Also die Griechen leben mehr im heute und Deutsche wollen die Zukunft planen.

1791,Tax incentives for companies to switch to open source,"Without an external incentive, most companies develop their software in their silos, even if it's not about the core business. When we compare the number of proprietary and open source software developers globally, we roughly estimate that more than 95 percent of the software developed as proprietary software.

This over-protective approach results in companies making investments that potentially overlap and lead them to reinvent similar solutions. We could substantially reduce these overlaps and increase efficiency by explicitly investing in open source software and pooling resources.

The EU can set up an open source subsidy program to create strong incentives for companies to switch from proprietary to open source. If a company declares to build their software as open source, they can/should get a tax break for each dedicated developer/employee via this program.

How to accurately validate the information that companies will provide and the ideal size of the subsidy needs to be studied. The initial goal should be to encourage companies to open their non-essential software.

In the long term, we should minimize proprietary and maximize open source to increase collaboration between companies and foster innovation in the software ecosystem.","Without an external incentive, most companies develop their software in their silos, even if it's not about the core business.

- The maintainer should be an EU citizen

- The software must be using an open source license

437,Permettre aux européens de d’échanger en toute sécurité,"Bonjour,

J’aimerais que l’UE développe un réseau social GRATUIT et sécurisé à destination des européens ainsi qu’une boite email européenne.

Pourquoi ?

- Supprimer vente de données 

- Des messages et des emails sécurisés 

- Éviter de recourir aux géants du numérique afin de pouvoir se connecter.

Ce que cela change ?

Une vie privée respectée.

Un réseau pour tous les européens donc une seule application à télécharger.

Une boite email européenne sécurisée.

Plus besoin d’accepter de vendre indirectement ses données.

Plus de pubs qui popent et qui se réfèrent à votre historique.

employment or whether they mainly contribute to outsourcing and replacement of quality

jobs by precarious jobs, an externalisation of (employers’) responsibility, a decrease of

1304,Una lingua per l'Unione Europea,"Il capitolo Brexit è giunto alla fine e il Regno Unito potrà dunque godersi la sua isolation. La terra di Albione ha sempre rappresentato un unicum all’interno dell’UE, tra clausole di opt out ed evidenti differenze tra il modello anglosassone e quello dell’Europa continentale. 

Un’UE più compatta potrà ora ergersi a interlocutore di pari grado di altre potenze internazionali come Cina e USA. Proprio per questo motivo, sarebbe auspicabile che l’UE si doti di una sua lingua istituzionale ufficiale che sia diversa dall’inglese o da qualsiasi altra lingua dei Paesi membri. Infatti, l'UE post Brexit non dovrà essere in posizione di sudditanza culturale rispetto ad una nazione che “presta” la propria lingua per le comunicazioni internazionali.  

Al contrario, la sua lingua ufficiale dovrà essere il riflesso della cultura europea: cioè la sintesi delle analogie, delle contaminazioni e delle differenze tra le varie culture europee.

L'unica lingua che abbia tutte queste caratteristiche è l'esperanto. Si tratta di un linguaggio inventato proprio da un europeo: il polacco Zamenhof). La mia proposta è che l'esperanto diventi la lingua ufficiale dell'Unione Europea e che sia quindi utilizzato nelle comunicazioni ufficiali e nella burocrazia interna, e che venga insegnato nelle scuole e università come seconda lingua.","The Brexit chapter has come to an end and the UK will therefore be able to enjoy its isolation. Albione’s land has always been an unicum within the EU, between opt-out clauses and clear differences between the Anglo-Saxon model and that of continental Europe.

For this very reason, it would be desirable for the EU to have its own official institutional language which is different from English or any other language of the Member States. Indeed, the post-Brexit EU should not be in a position of cultural subdivision with a nation that “lends” its own language for international communications. On the contrary, its official language should be the reflection of European culture: the synthesis of similarities, contamination and differences between European cultures. The only language that has all these characteristics is experanto. This is a language invented by a European: Polish Zamenhof).

1.	Remove barriers for voting in Europe! 

2.	Enable European representative democracy! New political and citizens’ movements have grown over the last years, but they have no chance to run for European elections. Barriers to entry are incredibly high, preventing many from expressing their new political ideas in the European Parliament. We want lower thresholds for running in the EU elections! We want a pan-European ballot so that citizens can express their European political issues instead of through 27 national ones.

3.	Establish a Federal Europe with a European Government, headed by visible leaders of the EU, which is elected by the European Parliament. This will create a strong, open, and transparent European parliamentary democracy.

4.	Ensure the EU’s ability to act by deciding by majority on all issues in the Council & transforming the Council of the EU into a second legislative chamber representing the federal element of Europe. 

5.	Empower Members of the European Parliament to fully represent citizens’ interests by being able to propose legislation.

Nur wie kommen wir da hin? Dazu bräuchten wir am Ende die Bereitschaft aller Länder, sich zu einer freiheitlichen europäischen Verfassung zu bekennen und das Prinzip der Einstimmigkeit in Europa aufzugeben. 

Die einzige Option die ich sehe: Wir brauchen eine Avantgarde wirtschaftlich bedeutsamer Länder (allen voran Frankreich, Italien und Deutschland), die diesen Schritt zur europäischen Verfassung geht, auch ohne darin zwangsläufig alle anderen Staaten mit einzubeziehen. Die EU würde damit weiter existieren, die entsprechenden Länder wären dann eben nicht nur EU- sondern auch VSE- Mitglieder. Das entspricht in etwa dem Europa der zwei Geschwindigkeiten: einige politisch bereitwillige und wirtschaftlich starke Staaten wagen die Integration in einen europäischen Bundesstaat. Da dieser eine weitere wirtschaftliche Vertiefung mit sich brächte, würde dieser Bundesstaat mittelfristig attraktiv für alle weiteren EU-Mitglieder.

An einem gewissen Punkt braucht es historische, mutige Schritte, um Europa voranzubringen. In den letzten Jahrzehnten waren die Schritte zur politischen Integration Europas oft nicht mutig genug - wenn der Traum einmal wahr werden soll, muss man manche verkrustete Struktur der EU aufzubrechen bereit sein.","My dream for Europe is a kind of state based on a German or American model: a Constitution for the United States of Europe, with political institutions that speak with one voice on important foreign and domestic policy issues. Just how do we get there? In the end, we would need the willingness of all countries to commit to a free European constitution and to abandon the principle of unanimity in Europe. The only option I see: We need an avant-garde of economically important countries (mainly France, Italy and Germany) to take this step towards the European Constitution, even without necessarily involving all other countries. The EU would therefore continue to exist, and the corresponding countries would then not only be EU members but also SSE members. This corresponds roughly to the Europe of two speeds: some politically willing and economically strong states dare to integrate into a European state. As this would lead to further economic deepening, this state would be attractive to all other EU members in the medium term. At some point, historical and courageous steps are needed to move Europe forward. In recent decades, steps towards the political integration of Europe have often not been courageous enough — if the dream is to come true, one must be prepared to break up some of the encrusted structure of the EU.",How we could get to a European state,Democracy,de,2,comment_104545,,"Ποιός είναι ο σκοπός του Κράτους κατά την γνώμη σας;

- l'initiative citoyenne européenne pourrait être modifiée afin d'aboutir, en cas de succès, à la soumission au vote populaire d'un projet de modification du corpus législatif de l'UE (le périmètre exact serait à préciser, mais devrait inclure au minimum les traités fondateurs - TUE et TFUE);

- il pourrait être institué un droit de référendum, permettant au peuple européen de se prononcer sur les textes réglementaires nouvellement adoptés. Ce droit de référendum pourrait être obligatoire ou facultatif, en fonction de la hiérarchie et/ou de la nature du texte concerné.","The European Union today suffers from a significant deficit in democratic representativeness. Although the prerogatives of the European Parliament have been extended over time, it still does not have the legislative initiative. Worse still, European citizens have little say on the European Commission’s initiatives: public consultations seem to have no significant influence on the decisions ultimately taken, and the European Citizens’ Initiative is proving to be a very weak tool, since even if successful, it is the European Commission that takes ownership of the initiative. Following the model of direct democracy as it exists in Switzerland, the European Union could equip itself with tools that would help to involve people much more and make the EU a true democracy than it is not yet. In particular: — the European Citizens’ Initiative could be amended to result, if successful, in the submission to the popular vote of a draft amendment to the body of EU legislation (the exact scope would need to be clarified, but should include at least the founding Treaties — TEU and TFEU); — a right of referendum could be introduced, allowing the European people to express their views on newly adopted regulatory texts.

983,"Demokratisch legitimierte ""EU-Regierung"" statt Europäischer Rat","Die wesentlichen Entscheidungen werden vom Europäischen Rat getroffen, einem Organ, dem es an demokratischer Legitimation fehlt, da die nationalen Regierungen nur von ihren jeweiligen Bevölkerungen gewählt wurden und das vorrangig auch zu einem anderen Zweck. 

Im Extremfall ist der Regierungschef eines Mitgliedsstaates mit nur wenigen 100000 Einwohnern bei geringer Wahlbeteiligung und nur durch eine Koalition im Amt, aufgrund von unter 100000 Wählerstimmen in seiner Position, trifft aber Entscheidungen, die knapp 450 Millionen Menschen betreffen.

Viel besser wäre es, wenn die im EU-Parlament vertretenen Parteien nach erfolgter EU-Parlamentswahl eine Art EU-Regierung bilden würden, analog zur Regierungsbildung in einem Mitgliedsland. Diese EU-Regierung sollte nur der Bevölkerung und der europäischen Idee gegenüber verantwortlich sein, ohne Rücksicht auf die nationalen Egoismen und ohne die Möglichkeit, dass einzelne Staaten die ganze Gemeinschaft blockieren können. 

Nur so kann die EU bei der Bevölkerung an Akzeptanz gewinnen. Derzeit schieben die nationalen Regierungen gerne die Verantwortung nach Brüssel ab, sie würden ja gerne aktiv werden, warten aber auf eine europäische Regelung - die sie aber selbst im Rat blockieren und verhindern. 

Europa wird nur dann voran kommen, wenn es die Nationalstaaten mittelfristig hinter sich lässt.","The main decisions are taken by the European Council, an institution lacking democratic legitimacy, as national governments have been elected only by their respective populations and primarily for a different purpose. In extreme cases, the head of government of a Member State with only a few 100000 inhabitants, with low turnout and only through a coalition, is in his position due to less than 100000 voter votes, but takes decisions affecting almost 450 million people. It would be much better for the parties represented in the European Parliament to form a kind of EU government following EU parliamentary elections, similar to the formation of government in a Member State. This EU government should only be accountable to the people and the European idea, regardless of national egoisms and without the possibility for individual states to block the whole community. This is the only way to make the EU more acceptable to the general public. At present, national governments are keen to shift responsibility to Brussels, they would like to take action, but they are waiting for a European regulation — which they themselves block and prevent in the Council.

This is inferior to open lists used in many countries, where it's the voters who decide the candidates' order on the list.
I think democracy should move always forward, never backwards. Moving from open lists to closed lists is moving backwards, so I can't support it.
But if there were transnational lists, they would probably have to have very strict requirements for national representation.

En el actual sistema una vez el comité de ministros considera que ha habido una violación de derechos los lideres de los estados van a votar para poder sancionar a ese estado. 

El problema es que para que se puedan aplicar sanciones como por ejemplo eliminar su voto de la UE a la hora de legislar nuevas leyes, todos los estados tienen que votar a favor, es decir, tiene q ser unánime.

Esto es muy ineficaz debido a que por aliados políticos o distintos intereses esto no suele ocurrir.

Si no sale unanimidad se termina desechando el caso como ocurrió con el ejemplo de Polonia en el cual todos votaron a favor de las sanciones a excepción de su aliado Hungría.

Propongo que este sistema cambie a una mayoría del 75% de los votos para no permitir injusticias como las que han ocurrido recientemente con Polonia.

The problem is that in order for sanctions to be applied, such as eliminating their EU vote when legislating new laws, all states have to vote in favour, i.e. they have to be unanimous. This is very ineffective because this does not usually happen by political allies or different interests. If there is no unanimity, the case is dismissed as happened with the example of Poland in which everyone voted in favour of sanctions except for their ally Hungary.

1915,Renforcer la présence du Parlement européen à Strasbourg,"Strasbourg est le siège du Parlement européen. Depuis des années, la pratique a fait que les activités parlementaires sont divisées entre Strasbourg et Bruxelles.

Ces éléments sont pourtant factuellement fallacieux : il faudrait 500 millions d'euros pour rénover l'hémicycle à Bruxelles et les performances énergétiques des bâtiments y sont bien moins élevées. 

Pour des raisons historiques et démocratiques par ailleurs, le Parlement européen a toute sa place à Strasbourg. Comment construire un récit politique dans une ville qui n'inspire rien d'autre aux citoyens européens que la technocratie et les lobbys ? Comment renforcer la légitimité d'un Parlement contesté par des forces eurosceptiques toujours plus fortes sans l'éloigner des lobbys ? 

Enfin, puisqu'il est certain que la France, le Luxembourg et l'Allemagne n'abandonneront jamais Strasbourg et qu'il faut l'unanimité des Etats membres pour modifier le Traité, pourquoi ne pas rendre plus efficace l'institution dans les limites légales actuelles plutôt que de chercher constamment à affaiblir Strasbourg en sachant pertinemment que Bruxelles ne pourra jamais être le siège unique du Parlement ?","Strasbourg is the seat of the European Parliament.

Speakers of Romance and Slavic languages are at a great disadvantage here, as are Hungarians; they need about twice as much time for English as Dutch people, Scandinavians or Germans.

Lower language skills mean less opportunity to participate in European democratic processes, which in very many cases take place in English. English as the de facto working language of the EU means the exclusion of many people in the south and east of the EU. Nothing indicates that this limitation to democratic participation will diminish in the future. The north-west of the EU tends to ignore this democracy problem.

The culture language Esperanto can be learned in a quarter of the time needed for English. This makes participation in Europe-wide discussion much easier, especially for people from the south and east, and is more just.

A major linguistic advantage is that Esperanto study provides an ideal introduction to the study of language. The European root stock provides an important resource for building vocabulary in English and in other European languages. Esperanto has a valuable and unusual literature, comprising both translations from national languages and original work. This provides a valuable tool to promote cultural awareness. There are increasing numbers of North American schools and colleges which offer Esperanto. In addition, a fairly wide selection of materials suitable for school and college Esperanto courses are available. (RW)""

Moreover, I am afraid that it will contribute to a sort of disconnection between the European project and people who do care about their language. We can see that in Switzerland for example, having different languages has been very well managed. It can be argued, however, that managing 3 languages is not the same as managing 24 languages.

On the other hand, if we're only looking at the perspective of having a common language, maybe Latin would be better? It has been in European history a key language and has existed for centuries, so it might be better accepted by the population? Israel revived Hebrew so I guess Europe could revive Latin.

Purtroppo il termine ""Commissario Europeo"" non fa pensare ad un politico i membri della Commissione lo siano per definizione. La Commissione è già attualmente un governo dell'Unione. Perché non renderlo ufficiale? 

Propongo di cambiare nome alla Commissione e di chiamarla ""Governo dell'Unione Europea"" guidato da un Primo Ministro o Presidente del Governo, responsabile di fronte al Parlamento Europeo.  Di fatto, il capo del partito europeo più grande all'interno della coalizione andrebbe nominato Premier. Andrebbe quindi limitato il diritto di scelta del nome da parte del Consiglio Europeo, che dovrebbe scegliere tra gli Spitzenkandidaten. A questo si collegherebbero la trasformazione del Presidente del Consiglio Europeo in Presidente Federale e del Consiglio in Senato degli stati ma si tratterebbe, di fatto, di altre proposte.

Il faut une démonstration mondiale de la puissance et de la maîtrise technologique de l'UE, en créant dès les prochaines élections une plateforme de vote électronique, qui fera de l'UE un exemple en la matière: sécurité du vote, confidentialité, exemple pour le monde.

The European Union must be willing to get involved in it, and must show that it is at the forefront of modern democracies. Technology companies in the European Union are performing well, and are paving the way for the future through research and development. Postal votes in elections are often pleaded (cf. US elections of 2020). In order to bring voters, especially younger voters, closer to the institutions; to show the EU’s technological strength and its capacity to develop projects that pave the way for future democracy; in order to make life easier for hundreds of millions of Europeans, we need a global demonstration of the EU’s power and technological mastery, setting up an electronic voting platform as soon as possible, which will make the EU an example in this area: voting security, confidentiality, example for the world.

65935,Demokratie nach dem Subsidiaritätsprinzip,"Global gesehen sind Demokratien zunehmend bedroht. Ein wesentlicher Grund dafür ist, dass das Subsidiaritätsprinzip zu wenig angewendet wird. 

Ich bin ein Anhänger der repräsentativen Demokratie. Bei der direkten Demokratie sind die Wähler überfordert. Ich würde es mir zB nicht zutrauen, einen Kommissionspräsidenten direkt zu wählen, einfach deswegen, weil ich die Wahlkandidaten persönlich zu wenig kennen würde. In diesem Dilemma könnte das Subsidiaritätsprinzip Abhilfe schaffen. Das Subsidiaritätsprinzip inkludiert ein hierarchisches Muster. Wichtig wäre es mir, dass ausschließlich Personen und keine politischen Parteien gewählt werden.

Konkret könnten Wahlen zB folgendermaßen aussehen:

1. Die Wahlberechtigten eines Ortsteils wählen einen Gemeinderat.

2. Verschiedene Ortsteile ergeben in ihrer Gesamtheit eine Gemeinde. Alle Gemeinderäte bilden zusammen die Vertretung ihrer Gemeinde. Die Gemeinderäte selbst wählen aus ihrem Kreis den Bürgermeister, die Stadträte etc.

3. Die Gemeinderäte wählen aus ihrem Kreis eine Person für die nächsthöhere Ebene, den Bezirk.

4. Alle Kandidaten eines Bezirks wählen aus ihrem Kreis für den Bezirk die politische Vertretung.

5. Alle gewählten Personen einer politischen Ebene wählen nach dem bereits erwähnten Muster die Vertreter für die nächsthöhere Ebene, bis zur EU-Ebene.

6. Das Abwählen einer Person erfolgt über die nächstniedrigere Ebene. Die Vertreter einer Gemeinde zB können jederzeit ihren eigenen Kandidaten für den Bezirk abwählen.","From a global perspective, democracies are increasingly threatened. An essential reason for this is that the principle of subsidiarity is not being applied too little. I am a supporter of representative democracy. In direct democracy, voters are overwhelmed. I would not, for example, dare to elect a President of the Commission directly, simply because I would know the candidates too little personally. In this dilemma, the principle of subsidiarity could remedy this. The principle of subsidiarity includes a hierarchical pattern. It would be important to me that only persons and no political parties should be elected. In concrete terms, elections could, for example, be as follows: 1. The electors of a local district elect a municipal council. 2. Various districts make up a municipality as a whole. All municipal councils together form the representation of their municipality. The municipal councils themselves elect from their district the mayor, the city councils, etc. 3. The councillors choose from their district a person for the next higher level, the district. 4. All candidates in a district elect political representation from among their districts. 5. All elected members of a political level select the representatives for the next higher level, up to the EU level, according to the model mentioned above. 6.

En effet, dans le système actuel, les candidats ne doivent répondre de leur action que devant leurs compatriotes.

Donc, chacun défend les intérêts de son pré carré national et on n'avance pas dans les dossiers vraiments importants, ceux qui concernent les grecs autant que les finlandais, les français, les néerlandais....

Si un candidat devait, pour être élu, obtenir un pourcentage défini dans son pays plus un autre pourcentage, plus bas, mais dans les 26 autres pays de l'Union sans exception, il devrait agir dans l'intérêt vraiment général.

Et ce serait, de plus, une manière démocratique de lutter contre le populisme et l'extrémisme, car monter les uns contre les autres ne rapporterait plus rien électoralement.

But if we think a bit further, we come to the conclusion that it is the whole European project that will fail if the idea is not implemented.

Thus, everyone defends the interests of their national pré and we do not put forward in important cases, those concerning Greek as much as Finnish, French, Dutch, etc. If a candidate were to obtain a defined percentage in his country plus a lower percentage in order to be elected, but in the other 26 EU countries without exception, he would have to act in the real general interest. Moreover, it would be a democratic way to fight against populism and extremism, as it would no longer be an electron against each other.

While I agree that in a democracy, it is indeed needed to be able to influence law making, often this results in hyper-complicated laws, full of loopholes, written by, and for, certain rich players.

Perhaps we could imagine a solution for the lobbying platform, as a lobbying tool: a website where new laws get published while they are still in the making, and provide the possibility in the tool to anonymously suggest improvements/changes to the law. The lawmaker could then decide, purely based on the anonymous merits of each change, whether or not to include it in the law.

63989,Formation européenne à la gouvernance à multi-niveaux et cycle de formation des fonctionnaires nationaux,"L’Union Européenne a promu les idées de gouvernance à multi-niveaux et de subsidiarité active. Ce faisant elle a été la première à assumer le fait qu’aucun défi des sociétés aujourd’hui ne peut être relevé à un seul niveau de gouvernance et qu’il faut définir les modalités concrètes de coopération entre ces différents niveaux plutôt que de procéder, de manière toujours illusoire, à la répartition des compétences entre ces différents niveaux. Malheureusement, cette vision nouvelle de la gouvernance, indispensable si l’on veut donner à cette dernière la légitimité qui bien souvent lui fait défaut aujourd’hui, comme l’illustre la crise de la démocratie représentative,  reste étrangère aux cultures administratives et politiques  nationales. Un grand programme d’échange entre fonctionnaires  des différents Etats membres et de formation aux principes et méthodes de la gouvernance à multi-niveaux s’avère nécessaire. 

La mise à disposition par différents Etats membres de fonctionnaires nationaux à la Commission Européenne est certes utile pour ouvrir les fonctions publiques nationales à l’Europe mais ne suffisent pas, tant s’en faut, à organiser cette véritable mutation culturelle. Ce n’est plus seulement des collèges européens à Bruges ou à Florence dont nous avons besoin, c’est d’une formation commune des  fonctions publiques en Europe.","The European Union has promoted the ideas of multi-level governance and active subsidiarity. In doing so, it was the first to assume the fact that no challenge of societies today can be tackled at a single level of governance and that it is necessary to define the concrete modalities of cooperation between these different levels rather than to carry out, in an always illusory way, the division of competences between these different levels. Unfortunately, this new vision of governance, which is indispensable if it is to be given the legitimacy that it often lacks today, as illustrated by the crisis of representative democracy, remains alien to national administrative and political cultures. A major programme of exchange between officials from the different Member States and training in the principles and methods of multi-level governance is necessary. The provision by different Member States of national officials to the European Commission is certainly useful in opening up national public functions to Europe, but it is not enough to organise this real cultural change.

2128,Adopter le latin moderne comme langue commune européenne,"Malgré le multilinguisme officiel, l'anglais est actuellement la principale langue de fonctionnement des institutions européennes. Ce parti pris officieux entraîne la soumission de l’Union européenne aux Etats-unis, et crée des discriminations fortes entre citoyens européens (entre ceux qui peuvent se payer des cours particuliers / séjours linguistiques, et les autres).

Une meilleure solution serait que l'Europe redécouvre la langue commune qui a été la sienne pendant presque 2000 ans : le latin. Historiquement, c’est le latin qui a permis l’unité européenne : dans la diplomatie, les sciences, les universités, le commerce, la culture,…

Certes, le latin n’est plus parlé dans aucun pays, mais ses racines sont toujours très présentes dans les fondements des sciences, de la philosophie, du droit, et même dans notre vie quotidienne, ne serait-ce lorsque nous rédigeons un ""curriculum vitae"" (CV) ou un ""PS"". On trouve de nombreuses inscriptions latines sur nos monuments, bâtiments, églises, etc.

C'est pourquoi une initiative européenne travaille actuellement à moderniser le latin classique pour en faire une langue simple et rapide à apprendre, sans déclinaisons.

152,Auf dem Weg zu den Vereinigten Staaten von Europa,"Insbesondere vor dem Hintergrund der internationalen Bedeutung Europas halt ich die weitere Vergemeinschaftung von zentralen Themen (Verteidigung, innere Sicherheit, Außenpolitik, Digitalisierung, Binnenmarkt, Umwelt- und Klimaschutz u.a.) für dringend notwendig. Dazu ist es an der Zeit, eine gemeinsame europäische Verfassung zu diskutieren und zu verabschieden sowie den Einfluss der Nationalstaaten in den genannten Bereichen  deutlich zu reduzieren. 

Um die Akzeptanz für ein geeintes Europa zu bekommen, bedarf es der regionalen Identitäten und ihrer kulturellen Verschiedenartigkeit. Kultur, Kunst und Bildung in ihrer Verschiedenartigkeit zu fördern ist eine der drängendsten Aufgaben, wenn andererseits eine Vergemeinschaftung von zentralen Themen gelingen soll.

Es ist von zentraler Bedeutung, die europäischen Regionen zu stärken. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist die Bedeutung des AdR im EU-Institutionenkanon zu erhöhen. In Analogie zum deutschen Bundesrat sollte der AdR entsprechende Gesetzgebungskompetenz bekommen. Das Ziel sollte ein föderales Europa sein, dass mehr von seinen Regionen als von seinen Staaten geprägt wird.","In particular, given the international importance of Europe, I believe that further communisation of key issues (defence, internal security, foreign policy, digitalisation, internal market, environmental and climate protection, etc.) is urgently needed. To this end, it is time to discuss and adopt a common European constitution and to significantly reduce the influence of the nation states in these areas. In order to be accepted for a united Europe, regional identities and their cultural diversity are needed. Promoting culture, art and education in their diversity is one of the most pressing tasks if, on the other hand, the communisation of central themes is to succeed. It is essential to strengthen the European regions. Against this background, the importance of the CoR in the EU institutional canon should be increased. By analogy with the German Bundesrat, the CoR should have appropriate legislative competence. The aim should be a federal Europe that will be shaped more by its regions than by its states.",Towards the United States of Europe,Democracy,de,52,comment_15176,,"Eine Europäische Union ohne Verfassung ist eine Totgeburt.

When people come to the conclusion that others are given more powers, and that their valid own interests are neglected or not duly respected, they will feel overwhelmed and alienated. 

In the EU, power is spelled in national terms only for the biggest actors like Germany. For most others, it is more available through transnational cooperation, which includes more compromising, or in the form of obstruction, which doesn't strengthen positive ties.

But if insufficient representation is a systemic issue, then we need to explore new ways, open up new alleys for people to own Europe.

That is why I propose to establish macroregional subsections of the European Parliament. The general assembly of the EP should be accompanied by subfora of EP members from each European region. 

Regional affiliations matter in terms of representation. It matters, if political power holders represent the diverse makeup of Europe, or if they tend to come from just one country or region. But apart from personnel decisions, we need a structural way to channel diverse regional identities and interests into our system of political representation. 

EP subfora for European regions like the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Atlantic or Central Europe could be a way to achieve just that.

1270,Het Nederlands als de officiële voertaal van de EU,"Als je op dit forum rondkijkt, valt het al snel op dat er meerdere deelnemers zijn die voorstellen om het Engels tot de énige officiële taal van Europa te bombarderen. Ondanks het feit dat dit rampzalig zou zijn voor de culturele & taalrijkdom van het Europese continent. We zien immers dat andere talen (zoals het Nederlands) al een gigantisch functieverlies ervaren in wetenschap, hoger onderwijs, handel, politiek, enzovoort.

Daarom stel ik voor om niet het Engels, maar juist het Nederlands te aanvaarden als de algemene inter-Europese lingua franca. En zo raar is dat niet eens, immers:

-> De meeste Europeanen die al bekend zijn met een Germaanse taal (zoals het Engels of Duits) kunnen het Nederlands vrij snel onder de knie krijgen;

-> Nederland heeft geen lange geschiedenis van agressie (zowel militair als cultureel) tegenover de rest van Europa (in tegenstelling tot de landen waar het Engels, Frans en Duits uit zijn ontstaan ...) en is daarom een stuk neutraler;

-> Daarom is het Nederlands een stuk minder bedreigend voor de rest van Europa dan het Engels. 

-> De Nederlandse taal is een andere taal dan het Engels; en geeft Europa de kans om zich te differentiëren van de Engelse wereldcultuur.

In 't kort: Nederlands is een stuk neutraler, is een stuk minder bedreigend, is relatief makkelijk om te leren én is daarbovenop ook nog een échte, door de wol geverfde Europese taal met alle rijkdom, geschiedenis en expressiemogelijkheid die Europa verdient!

Het is een optie! :-)","If you look around this forum, it soon notices that there are several participants who are proposing to bomb English into the only official language of Europe. Despite the fact that this would be disastrous for the cultural and linguistic richness of the European continent. After all, we see that other languages (such as Dutch) already experience a huge loss of function in science, higher education, trade, politics, etc. That is why I propose to accept not English, but rather Dutch as the general inter-European lingua franca. And it’s not that weird, after all: —> most Europeans who are already familiar with a Germanic language (such as English or German) can learn Dutch quite quickly; —> The Netherlands has no long history of aggression (both military and cultural) vis-à-vis the rest of Europe (as opposed to the countries from which English, French and German originated...) and is therefore much more neutral; —> therefore, Dutch is a lot less threatening for the rest of Europe than English. —> the Dutch language is a language other than English; and gives Europe the opportunity to differentiate from the English world culture. In short: Dutch is a lot more neutral, is a lot less threatening, is relatively easy to learn and is also a real, wool-painted European language with all the richness, history and expression that Europe deserves!

284,Language as a mean to communication: Institutionalise a second language to be learned in all EU Member States,"Additionally to fostering European diversity through multilingualism, a realistic mean of communication between EU citizens has to be provided. There should be a common second language in the EU as a tool to build a European identity, which co-exists with national identities, as a mean to communication, not identification. People learn languages based on their usefulness and having to take bets very early on as to what would provide them with the maximum potential future (global) opportunities. Despite some opposition, English is the natural choice for most, with demand unlikely to diminish. 

In an EU setting, it is neutral - with no EU Member State having it registered as its official language (any more); therefore it does not provide for conflict and should just be seen as first among equals. 

Most importantly, it does not decrease diversity if one of the three languages that EU citizens are meant to speak is a common one. It would actually enable us to be more diverse.  

Once established, it would reduce the need for translation and it would remove barriers to the freedom of movement, as well as make the “opportunity gap” smaller between individuals. 

Of course, cultural identity should be protected by the multilingual approach; communication between citizens however, as well as a level playing, also have to be fostered, and they require a common language – the key here is that these two approaches are not mutually exclusive.","Additionally to fostering European diversity through multilingualism, a realistic mean of communication between EU citizens has to be provided.

107812,Knocking at the Glass Ceiling: Women in the EU Politics ,"To be effective and just, representative democracy should mirror the demos. Women constitute about half of the society, but do they enjoy a respective representation? The EU is a front runner in this regard. The situation varies greatly among the Member States, but on average women comprised 33% of national parliaments and cabinets in 2020, four were heads of state. A far cry from gender parity. 



Women have more seats at the political table, but not necessarily more say. A greater formal representation does not automatically translate into more even power distribution. Social attitudes and biases do not cease to exist overnight because of new regulations and quotas. Women politicians often face more hateful personal attacks, struggle to have their voices heard and be taken seriously: not only in the parliaments, but also in media and society.  

“Sofa gate” showed that the authority gap still exists and even top female politicians face gender discrimination.

Woman quotas, in place in ten EU countries, can be one solution, but not a panacea.

8584,The European Union should decide on a European Constitutional Declaration.,"In order to achieve a European Constitution in a meaningful period of time, it will be necessary to concentrate on a short, pointed and rather declaratory text.

Such a European Constitutional Declaration of no more than five to ten pages, could easily be combined with necessary (and ever ongoing) revisions of individual paragraphs and chapters in the Treaty on the European Union and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In pursuing such a simplified path, the EU will finally receive a Constitution that would combine the declaratory text with the existing treaties constituting binding primary law. The European Constitutional Declaration would serve as a bracket around the treaties, as a sort of preamble ahead of the finesse and subtleties of EU primary law.

420,I propose to incorporate blockchain technology into the democratic process (i.e. in elections),"Blockchain / DLT has many usecases, one of which is to enable better security and verifiability in elections. By having people vote publicly on the blockchain under a pseudonym, it would be possible to analyze the results within minutes, while having full transparency of the process. 

This helps with building trust in the outcome, as everybody could theoretically count the votes for themselves in case of alleged fraud. A system like that would also open the door to many new possibilities, that require to much work to be feasable today. We could have more frequent elections even about less impactful things. This would give back power to the people, and help reduce administrative effort.

This would make it possible to target completely new questions via voting.

There are also some possible problems/obstacles with this proposal, that i will adress here. The main ones are, that:

1. we would have to make sure, the pseudonym used to vote cannot be traced back to the actual person.

2. it would require big investments in the nessessary infrastructure.

3. the ability for people to have access to this system must be guaranteed.

Ma se il parlamento europeo è relegato a un ruolo secondario rispetto alle altre istituzioni dell'Unione Europea, le elezioni europee così ""democratiche"" non sono.

The European party or parties that have a majority should present to them the President of the European Commission, a person elected in that parliamentary term in Parliament.

In the field of education, programmes on European integration (which could also be called the history of the European Union) may vary greatly in their implementation and content depending on the Member States. Although this competence lies with their ministries, it might be useful to provide a harmonised historical version so as not to rewrite the common history to the progress of changes in the governance of these states.

Cela va avec un manque de formation à l’esprit critique et aux valeurs de la démocratie. Les discours eurosceptiques, europhobes et nationalistes ont toute liberté, jusque dans les programmes scolaires. 

D’urgence, l’Europe doit reconquérir les écoles mais aussi porter l’identité culturelle et historique solidaire, multilingue et interculturelle de la société européenne. Il faut rassembler les générations et recréer une intelligence collective de l’avenir, avec la participation active et informée des citoyens, jusqu’au niveau local. 

Erasmus+, le Corps de volontaires européens et l’Europe Créative nourrissent le sens d’appartenance des Européens mais les actions sont trop fragmentées. L’accès à ces programmes phares de l’UE doit être systématisé. Les financements européens devraient inclure une formation obligatoire de ce type.

Le temps est venu de réexaminer les compétences de l’UE que permettent les traités et de lancer une stratégie européenne coordonnée pour cette éducation qui comprenne un programme pour les écoles primaires et secondaires.

Nous devons inclure les écoles dans la dynamique créée par la Conférence sur l’avenir de l’Europe. Cet exercice pratique de démocratie est en outre l’occasion de réévaluer les actions de l’UE et des Etats membres pour l’éducation à la citoyenneté afin de faire face aux défis de nos démocraties.","The lack of knowledge about the history and policies of the EU, as well as about citizens’ rights, is huge in the Member States. This goes with a lack of training in critical thinking and the values of democracy. Eurosceptic, Europhobic and nationalist discourses are free, even in school curricula. As a matter of urgency, Europe must regain schools but also bear the solidarity, multilingual and intercultural cultural and historical identity of European society. We must bring together generations and re-create a collective intelligence of the future, with the active and informed participation of citizens, up to the local level. Erasmus+, the European Volunteer Corps and Creative Europe foster the sense of belonging of Europeans but the actions are too fragmented. Access to these EU flagship programmes needs to be systematised. European funding should include such mandatory training. The time has come to review the EU competences provided for in the Treaties and to launch a coordinated European strategy for this education which includes a programme for primary and secondary schools. We must include schools in the momentum created by the Conference on the Future of Europe.

Dazu schlage ich die Kombination von zwei Maßnahmen vor:

1. Online-Sprachkurse: Junge Menschen lernen in der Schule inzwischen zwei oder mehr Fremdsprachen, Andere hatten diese Gelegenheit nicht. Wie wäre es, wenn die Europäische Union zu jedem runden Geburtstag einen Gutschein für einen kostenlosen Sprachkurs im EU-System Online Linguistic Support verschenkt? Das System wurde für Erasmus+ konzipiert, wird aber im Rahmen der Integrationspolitik auch schon für Geflüchtete geöffnet. So ein bereits funktionierendes System könnte durch einen Kapazitätsausbau die Verständigung in Europa fördern, einen Beitrag zum lebenslangen Lernen im digitalen Raum leisten und die öffentliche Wahrnehmung der Europäischen Union verbessern.

2. Austauschforen: Wer eine neue Sprache lernt oder seine Sprachkenntnisse verbessert hat oft Interesse an der Gesellschaft des Landes dessen Sprache er oder sie sich erarbeitet.

I believe giving the Youth an 'allowance' welfare of 50€ on top of whatever is currently established in the EU countries allows the Youth to stay to the same standards as his generation that have jobs.

Allowing digital jobs easier, which has other positive consequences, for example, less transportation to workplaces. But it also allows for a more satisfied and less impoverished youth, allowing for an overall better boost in life satisfaction. 

Especially when the Youth is the first to go from jobs or apprenticeships when a recession or challenge such as a pandemic comes, the EU needs to help the potential lost generation in solving the crises.

Das Erlernen von Fremdsprachen in der EU ist verbesserungsbedürftig
Den Europäern fällt die Verständigung untereinander schwer, da ihnen die nötigen Sprachfertigkeiten fehlen. Nur wenige können fremdsprachigen Radio- oder Fernsehprogrammen folgen, geschweige denn in einer anderen Sprache diskutieren. Das Zusammengehörigkeitsgefühl der Europäer leidet unter dieser großen Hürde. Die EU muss das Erlernen von Fremdsprachen radikal verbessern.

Dort hat das Programm ""Multilingual Accelerator"" belegt, dass sich die Fremdsprachenfertigkeiten von 8- und 9-jährigen Schulkindern erheblich und schnell verbessern, nachdem ihnen zuerst begrenzte und sorgfältig ausgewählte Kenntnisse einer logisch aufgebauten, lebenden Sprache (Esperanto) vermittelt wurden. Die dabei erzielten Erfolgserlebnisse ermöglichten es den Kindern, andere Sprachen anschließend in kürzerer Zeit und mit besserem Ergebnis zu lernen.

Citizens call on the EU to disseminate the results of an innovative Erasmus+ program which has proved successful in a number of primary schools in 3 EU countries (Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia) in 2018 and 2019. The “Multilingual Accelerator” (https://epale.ec.europa.eu/en/content/multilingual-accelerator-now-you-have-opportunity-accelerate-language-learning-your-students) program showed a significant and rapid improvement in foreign-language skills of schoolchildren aged 8 to 9, who acquired these skills by first learning a limited and carefully-chosen amount of a logical living language, Esperanto. Their sense of achievement enabled these children to subsequently learn other languages more successfully and rapidly. Their teachers, who had no previous knowledge of the language, only needed a one-week course to enable them to teach the program.

Citizens call on the EU to encourage the Ministries of Education of all 27 EU-countries to reproduce this school program, under professional pedagogical supervision, and on a larger scale, to test the effectiveness of this innovative approach, which has the potential to revolutionize language learning throughout the EU 27.",The EU needs improved language learning ,Education,en,721,comment_98313,,"Szeretettel ajánlom még ""Boldogabb nyelvtanulók, sikeresebb nyelvtanárok"" című javaslatomat: Boldogabb nyelvtanulók, sikeresebb nyelvtanárok   ---   Elkore mi rekomendas ankorau' mian proponon sun titolo ""Pli felic'aj lingvolernantoj, pli sukcesaj lingvoinstruistoj"": Boldogabb nyelvtanulók, sikeresebb nyelvtanárok ",0.0,comment_98313,True,5,0,hu,2021-09-24T11:45:03+02:00

besseres Verständnis der Menschen Europas füreinander zu

leisten.

Unser Leitmotiv: ""Wenn wir wollen, dass Europa eine Zukunft hat, müssen wir den Kindern eine Stimme geben."" Dafür haben wir den Förderverein europäische Kinderhauptstadt gegründet. Kinder sind unsere Zukunft, richtig. Kinder sind aber auch schon da!

Was wollen wir?

Wir wollen, dass die Kinder Europas sich jedes Jahr in einer anderen europäischen Stadt treffen. Denn wir glauben, dass man nur durch Begegnungen Verständnis für andere entwickeln kann.

Wir wollen, dass die Bewerberstädte beweisen müssen, dass sie es ernst meinen mit der Beteiligung und Mitsprache von Kindern, wenn es um deren Rechte geht. Die Städte sollen den Auftrag erhalten, die Kinder der Mitgliedsstaaten einander näher zu bringen und so einen Beitrag für ein

besseres Verständnis der Menschen Europas füreinander zu

leisten.

Wir wollen, dass Europa seine Kinder an der Gestaltung der Zukunft beteiligt, so wie es die UN-Kinderrechtskonvention schon 1989 festgelegt hat.

Wir wollen, dass die Kinder Europa einmal im Jahr bunt anmalen und den Kontinent wieder lächeln lassen.

1819,Bildungsungleichheiten in der EU beheben - Angleichung der Bildungssysteme (bzw. Vereinheitlichung der Bildungssysteme) ,"Wie sich in den PISA-Studien der letzten Jahre zeigt, unterscheiden sich die Länder innerhalb der EU vom Bildungsniveau stark. Wir brauchen ein einheitlicheres, vorteilhafteres Bildungssystem, das durch die EU reguliert wird, um in Zukunft mehr Bildungsgleichheit zu gewährleisten und somit auch für jeden EU-Bürger ein Studium in einem anderen EU-Land zu ermöglichen.

Mögliche Verbesserungsvorschläge:

➔ Gleichsetzung der Abschlüsse auf EU-Ebene, um freie Studienplatzwahl zu ermöglichen 

➔ allgemeines Recht auf Bildung (mind. neun Jahre Schulzeit)

➔ schulische Bildung flächendeckend, qualitativ gleichwertig und kostenfrei ermöglichen 

➔ Lehrerjob attraktiver gestalten

➔ mehr Bildungseinrichtungen

➔ mehr Vorbereitung aufs spätere Leben (z.B. durch Schaffung eines oder mehrerer

zusätzlicher Fächer)

Durch die starken Unterschiede der Bildungssysteme könnte eine Angleichung der Systeme in Phasen erfolgen, welche von jedem EU-Land in einem festgelegten Zeitraum erreicht werden müssen. Hierdurch könnte die ewige Diskussion, um Abschlüsse, welche unterschiedlich viel „Wert“ sind aus der Welt geschaffen werden.

Die Phasen könnten beispielweise wie folgt aussehen: 

1. Schaffung besserer nationaler Bildungsstrukturen (siehe obere Punkte, Förderung durch EU-

Gelder in strukturschwächeren Regionen)

2. Angleichung der Bildungssysteme auf nationaler Ebene (zentrale Abschlussprüfungen etc.)

Therefore, the Europe needs to invest more into career guidance and orientation. National curricula have to strengthen this dimension starting at youngest age.

Or un nombre très important de langues ne sont officielles nulle part et ne bénéficient donc d'aucune (ou peu) de protection.

Alors que l'on se gargarise de notre devise ""Unis dans la diversité"", la réalité est plus sombre : dans le monde la moitié des 6000 langues parlées sont en danger ; on a coutume de dire qu'une langue meurt tous les 15 jours. Cette tendance existe aussi en Europe (qui est pourtant le continent linguistiquement le moins divers) et l'UE, qui est plurilingue sur le papier, est en réalité anglophone. Or une langue qui meurt, ce sont aussi une culture, un point de vue, une façon de penser qui disparaissent.

L'UE doit donc d'urgence se doter d'une politique véritablement multilingue, cesser de prioriser l'anglais, favoriser les apprentissages des langues entre pays/régions voisines, et se doter de capacités de sanction fortes et immédiates contre les pays qui font mourir leurs langues minoritaires.

La France a par exemple récemment interdit l'enseignement scolaire immersif en langue régionale, alors qu'elles sont toutes très en danger selon l'UNESCO. Cela revient à les condamner à mort, car la transmission parent-enfant est stoppée depuis la féroce politique de répression linguistique et d'ethnocide que la France mène depuis la Révolution et surtout depuis 1880. Une telle politique devrait être rendue impossible dans une UE qui protège toutes ses langues.","Today, the EU has 24 official languages, and a bit more official in its countries. However, a very large number of languages are not official at all and therefore have no (or few) protection. With our motto “United in diversity”, the reality is darker: half of the 6000 languages spoken worldwide are at risk; it is customary to say that a language dies every 15 days. This trend also exists in Europe (which is the least linguistically diverse continent) and the EU, which is multilingual on paper, is in fact English-speaking. Yet a language that dies, it is also a culture, from a point of view, a way of thinking that is disappearing. The EU therefore urgently needs to develop a truly multilingual policy, stop prioritising English, promote language learning between neighbouring countries/regions, and develop strong and immediate sanctioning capacities against countries that cause their minority languages to die. For example, France has recently banned immersive school education in regional language, although they are all very at risk according to UNESCO. This is tantamount to condemning them to death, as the parent-child transmission has been halted since the fierce policy of linguistic repression and ethnocide that France has pursued since the Revolution and especially since 1880. Such a policy should be made impossible in an EU that protects all its languages.","Use, protection and valorisation of minority and endangered languages.",Education,fr,5,comment_29338,,"Sources supplémentaires :

24553,"Usage, protection et valorisation des langues minoritaires et en danger.","Aujourd'hui l'UE possède 24 langues officielles, et un peu plus sont officielles dans ses pays. Or un nombre très important de langues ne sont officielles nulle part et ne bénéficient donc d'aucune (ou peu) de protection.

Alors que l'on se gargarise de notre devise ""Unis dans la diversité"", la réalité est plus sombre : dans le monde la moitié des 6000 langues parlées sont en danger ; on a coutume de dire qu'une langue meurt tous les 15 jours. Cette tendance existe aussi en Europe (qui est pourtant le continent linguistiquement le moins divers) et l'UE, qui est plurilingue sur le papier, est en réalité anglophone. Or une langue qui meurt, ce sont aussi une culture, un point de vue, une façon de penser qui disparaissent.

L'UE doit donc d'urgence se doter d'une politique véritablement multilingue, cesser de prioriser l'anglais, favoriser les apprentissages des langues entre pays/régions voisines, et se doter de capacités de sanction fortes et immédiates contre les pays qui font mourir leurs langues minoritaires.

La France a par exemple récemment interdit l'enseignement scolaire immersif en langue régionale, alors qu'elles sont toutes très en danger selon l'UNESCO. Cela revient à les condamner à mort, car la transmission parent-enfant est stoppée depuis la féroce politique de répression linguistique et d'ethnocide que la France mène depuis la Révolution et surtout depuis 1880. Une telle politique devrait être rendue impossible dans une UE qui protège toutes ses langues.","Today, the EU has 24 official languages, and a bit more official in its countries. However, a very large number of languages are not official at all and therefore have no (or few) protection. With our motto “United in diversity”, the reality is darker: half of the 6000 languages spoken worldwide are at risk; it is customary to say that a language dies every 15 days. This trend also exists in Europe (which is the least linguistically diverse continent) and the EU, which is multilingual on paper, is in fact English-speaking. Yet a language that dies, it is also a culture, from a point of view, a way of thinking that is disappearing. The EU therefore urgently needs to develop a truly multilingual policy, stop prioritising English, promote language learning between neighbouring countries/regions, and develop strong and immediate sanctioning capacities against countries that cause their minority languages to die. For example, France has recently banned immersive school education in regional language, although they are all very at risk according to UNESCO. This is tantamount to condemning them to death, as the parent-child transmission has been halted since the fierce policy of linguistic repression and ethnocide that France has pursued since the Revolution and especially since 1880. Such a policy should be made impossible in an EU that protects all its languages.","Use, protection and valorisation of minority and endangered languages.",Education,fr,5,comment_58147,,"“Unity” is the other part of the EU motto.
The EU is clearly disunited when it comes to a common language. Unlike some populous countries, the EU does not have any native language that would easily qualify as the lingua franca. In China, Mandarin Chinese works. In India, Hindi is widely understood. In USA, English dominates. In Brazil, Portuguese is the official language. In Russia, Russian is the only official language at the national level.
English is an easy choice for a common world-language, if EU citizens need to talk with people from other continents. However, in the continental Europe, English is spoken as an official language only in Gibraltar.

Europe Day held on 9 May every year celebrates peace and unity in Europe. The date marks the anniversary of the historic 'Schuman declaration'. At a speech in Paris in 1950, Robert Schuman, the then French foreign minister, set out his idea for a new form of political cooperation in Europe, which would make war between Europe's nations unthinkable.

His vision was to create a European institution that would pool and manage coal and steel production. A treaty creating such a body was signed just under a year later. Schuman's proposal is considered to be the beginning of what is now the European Union.

To celebrate Europe Day, the EU institutions traditionally open their doors to the public in early May. Local EU offices in Europe and all over the world organise a variety of activities and events for all ages.

Each year thousands of people take part in visits, debates, concerts and other activities to mark the day and raise awareness about the EU.

We would propose to take the celebrations to the next level and propose an EU wide national holiday so our European identity can be celebrated besides the national and regional ones.

Bessere Noten ohne zusätzlichen Aufwand? Nach heutigen Erkenntnissen der Chronobiologie ist das ganz einfach! Lernen genau dann, wenn man „gut funktioniert“, also ausgeschlafen ist! In vielen Ländern beginnt der Unterricht schon sehr früh. Jugendliche befinden sich in Ihrer Entwicklung, Schlafphasen verschieben sich dabei nach hinten. Die Verarbeitung von Lerninhalten findet aber genau dann statt, also erst  in den frühen Morgenstunden. Dann klingelt aber schon wieder der Wecker und beendet die Nacht vorzeitig. Lerninhalte sind noch gar nicht vollständig verarbeitet, die Schüler müssen aber wieder unausgeschlafen zur Schule. Müdigkeit prägt die ersten Unterrichtsstunden und verschlechtert die Aufnahmefähigkeit für neue Lerninhalte. 

Zu frühe Unterrichtszeiten verschlechtern in doppelter Hinsicht die Effizienz des Lernprozesses! 

Hinzu kommt noch die Sommer-Uhrzeit (DST). Von März bis Oktober beginnt die Schule noch eine Stunde früher. Der beschriebene Prozess wird also noch extrem verstärkt und trägt zum ineffizienten Lernen der Jugendlichen bei. 

Lösung: 

Erster Schritt - Abschaffung der Sommer-Uhrzeit (DST). Weitere Maßnahmen sollten flexiblere Schulzeiten sein. Pilotprojekte (Beispiel: Alsdorf-Gymnasium, Aachen) zeigen deutlich: Bessere Leistungen bei gleichem Aufwand. Auch der Deutsche Lehrerverband hat sich bereits dafür ausgesprochen.

Check: www.mathe-physik-technik.de","Adaptation of learning times to the inner clock of the students, abolition of summer time. Better grades without extra effort? According to today’s findings of chronobiology, this is quite simple! Learn just when you “work well”, so sleep out! In many countries, teaching begins very early. Teenagers are in their development, sleep phases shift backwards. However, the processing of learning content takes place exactly then, i.e. only in the early morning hours. Then the alarm clock rings again and ends the night early. Learning content is not yet fully processed, but the students have to go back to school without sleep. Fatigue characterises the first lessons and worsens the absorption capacity for new learning content. The efficiency of the learning process is deteriorating in two ways at an early stage! In addition, there is the summer time (DST). From March to October, the school starts one hour earlier. The process described is thus extremely reinforced and contributes to the inefficient learning of young people. Solution: First step – abolition of summer time (DST). Further measures should be more flexible school hours. Pilot projects (example: Alsdorf-Gymnasium, Aachen) clearly shows: Better performance with the same effort.

Les femmes doivent-elles avoir besoin d’apprendre le self-defense pour se sentir en sécurité ? Non.

Est-ce qu’apprendre certaines techniques dès leur plus jeune âge permettrait ou du moins leur donnerait une chance de se sortir d’une situation indésirable ? Oui.

J’aimerais que dès 15ans les filles se voient enseigner le self défense via les cours de sports disposés dans les écoles et ce jusqu’à l’âge de 18ans à raison de 1h par semaine / 1h toutes les deux semaines.

Apprendre à se défendre c’est aussi une façon d’éviter de se forcer sous la contrainte. Sans défense il n’y a pas d’échappatoire. Celle-ci ne réglera pas tout mais permettra à une femme de dire non en sachant qu’elle pourra se défendre si jamais l’intention orale passe à l’intention physique.

Man denke z.B. an jene Brit*innen, die zum 31. Januar 2020 ihren „europäischen“ Pass gegen ihren Willen verloren haben!  Um einzelne nationalstaatliche Interessen bzw. Bedenken (v.a. in den Bereichen Arbeitsmarkt und Migration) zu berücksichtigen, könnte dieser neue Status durch gewisse Einschränkungen im Vergleich zur „vollen“ europäischen Staatsbürgerschaft gekennzeichnet sein, der Pass etwa eine andere Farbe besitzen. Attraktiv wäre ein solches „Opt-in-Modell“ auch für Bürger*innen der EFTA-Staaten und der Staaten der Östlichen Partnerschaft (v.a. des Assoziierten Trios). Im Europäischen Parlament könnte man eine Anzahl von Sitzen für Abgeordnete reservieren, die exklusiv von solchen Wahlberechtigten gewählt und deren Stimmrechte separat geregelt werden.

In order to take account of individual national interests or concerns (especially in the areas of labour market and migration), this new status could be characterised by certain limitations compared to “full” European citizenship, the passport being of a different colour. Such an “opt-in model” would also be attractive for citizens of the EFTA and Eastern Partnership countries (especially the Associated Trio).

400,EU Self-marketing: Creating an “EU identity” and common symbolism,"In short: 

The EU lacks marketing. It needs to reach hearts of common people. Create an identity all citizens can be part and proud of. The value of the EU needs to be made visible. 

Background:

In discussing national identity it is often emphasised how a common myth of origin, and emotional identification play a crucial role in the functioning of a society bound by nationhood. The EU has the underlying components, but lacks the media to proliferate such emotions and ideas.

Challenge:

One of the main issues for the EU is a hostile environment amongst its citizens. A lot of negative press is based on a lack of identification with EU goals. 

Ideas:

Underlying is amongst other factors a lack of understanding:

- the EU political goals (policy)

- how the EU attempts to reach its goals politically (polity)

- knowledge which policies are being introduced based on EU initiative (versus national)

Thinkable solutions:

- creation of EU agency entrusted with improved communication via all media channels (crucial: moderated social media)

- introduction of schooling content on the EU functions that is the same all over the EU

Possible emotional factors are lack of:

- emotional identifiers

- transparency of the similarities in customs

 Thinkable solutions:

- introduction of a common celebratory day (such as 5th May)

- create an agency entrusted with supporting media events unifying all nations (e.g. sporting events. EU-wide leagues may be key)

- a TV channel?","In short:

78145,Energetische fundering van Body Europe,"Europa is een grote mix van allerlei beïnvloedingen : sociaal, cultureel, politiek, de dynamiek van al die interacties, die een bepaald gegeven dan naar voor brengen, een focus, een punt van attentie. Vanuit wat ik nu weet, is enkel een soort ‘holistische’ kijk op het geheel een ‘gamechanger’ dat effect en resultaat kan hebben. Dit wil zeggen : om iets op grotere schaal te veranderen, is het nodig, de basisenergie te veranderen. Stel, we willen meer harmonisering en positief resultaat voor iets, dan is het nodig op die specifieke basisenergie te activeren.  



Bekijk het zo : voel als je in harmonie bent (en merk op dat jouw ‘elektriciteit’ dat uitstraalt en effect heeft) en voel dat je in conflict bent (en dat straal je dan uit en dat effect heb je op alles dat ‘daarbuiten’ ligt). 

Nu, een Europese body is een elektrisch gegeven – het straalt haar eigen harmonie of disharmonie uit, gebaseerd op de ‘point of focus’ (het aandachtspunt, wat wil je weten of hebben).  Als er geen intentie is voor harmonie (onderliggend) dan is het onmogelijk grootschalige acties te doen vloeien, en als die dan toch even de kop opsteken, dan zullen ze snel geblust zijn.  Dus eerst de basisenergie, het platform aanpakken. Hoe ? Door een nieuwe straling door te voeren : harmonische straling : samenwerking, win-win, de connecties aanpakken etc… lijkt allemaal spiritueel, maar het is eigenlijk boerenverstand.

BVB een kok die niet graag kookt zal nooit lekker eten maken. Wat je doet, straal je uit.","Europe is a great mix of all kinds of influences: social, cultural, politics, the dynamics of all those interactions, which bring a particular data forward, a focus, a point of attention. From what I know now, only a kind of ‘holistic’ view of the whole is a game changer that can have effect and result. That is to say: to change something on a larger scale, it is necessary to change the basic energy. Suppose we want more harmonisation and positive results for something, it is necessary to activate that specific basic energy. Look at it like this: feel when you are in harmony (and notice that your ‘electricity’ radiates and has effect) and feel that you are in conflict (and then you radiate and that you have that effect on everything that is ‘outside’). Now, a European body is an electrical data – it exudes its own harmony or disharmonie, based on the ‘point of focus’ (the point of attention, what do you want to know or have). If there is no intention for harmony (underlying) then it is impossible to make large-scale actions flow, and if they do rise up, they will soon be extinguished. So first the basic energy, tackle the platform. How? By introducing a new radiation: harmonic radiation: cooperation, win-win, approaching the connections, etc... all seems spiritual, but it’s actually peasant mind.

1341,Größte Effizienz bei kleinster Bürokratie,"Der legislative Prozess könnte in zwei Teile geteilt werden: Die Art in der Europäer entscheiden, was zu tun ist, und die Art und Weise in der die Entscheidung dann umgesetzt wird. Effektivität und Effizienz.

Für jemanden, der einen EU-Job hat ist es wichtig, diesen nicht zu verlieren. Das ist fair, denn jede Person sollte ihren Lebensstandard erhalten dürfen. Gleichzeitig werden immer neue Probleme auf Europa zukommen und es ist einfach einen neuen Beraterstab oder andere Jobs zu schaffen. Die Menschen in diesen neuen Jobs wollen ihn natürlich auch nicht verlieren.

Langsam baut sich eine immer größere und größere Bürokratie auf und Prozesse werden langsamer und langsamer.

Lass uns etwas von unseren britischen Freunden lernen! 

Bei der Impfstoffbeschaffung war das Ziel klar und die Umsetzung hat eine Frau aus der Finanzwirtschaft übernommen. Diese hat ihren Job extrem gut erledigt, weit schneller als wir in Europa. Dann lasst uns doch das Gute, das Funktionierende übernehmen!

Die Entscheidungen, was zu tun ist, sollte vom EU Parlament beschlossen werden. Für die Umsetzung der Ideen sollten wir Verträge mit Professionellen Menschen machen, die Erfahrung haben. Nach der Erfüllung des Auftrags entfällt der Posten wieder. 

Ich denke wir gewinnen deutlich an Effizienz (siehe britisches Beispiel) und bauen keine schweren Bürokratien auf.

Effectiveness and efficiency. For someone who has an EU job, it is important not to lose it. This is fair because everyone should be allowed to maintain their standard of living. At the same time, Europe will face ever new problems and it is easy to create a new advisory team or other jobs. Of course, people in these new jobs do not want to lose it. Increasing and increasing bureaucracy is slowly building up and processes are becoming slower and slower. Let’s learn something from our British friends! With regard to vaccine procurement, the objective was clear and the implementation took over a woman from the financial sector. This has done its job extremely well, far faster than we in Europe. Then let us take over the good thing that works! Decisions on what to do should be decided by the EU Parliament.

2.	Mit einfachen Themen beginnen: 

2.1	Gemeinsame und solidarischen Wirtschaftspolitik.

2.2	Dann gemeinsame Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik, denn die Außengrenzen sind klar definiert. Der Auftrag: die Staaten der Union zu schützen und im Angriffsfall zu verteidigen.

2.3	Protektion der Wirtschaft des europäischen Binnenmarktes gegen kriminelle äußere Einflüsse. Europäische Gerichte, Staatsanwaltschaft und Polizei.

2.4	Weitere europäische Exekutivorgane und Behörden.

3.	Harmonisierung, also Angleichung der Steuern, das wird die schwierigste Aufgabe. Hier geht es um das Geld.

81148,Fortalecimiento del Eurocuerpo para defender las fronteras europeas y garantizar la seguridad de los ciudadanos de los países miembros,"Los refugiados políticos y el terrorismo conforman dos de los principales problemas los que se enfrenta la Unión Europea en la actualidad. 

Debido al panorama internacional actual, la vulnerabilidad de las fronteras europeas requiere una mayor atención, y por ello deben ser defendidas. Los acontecimientos en Afganistán y el posible auge del terrorismo ya vivido en este mismo país tras el reciente atentado de ISIS-K, demuestran la importancia de formar un ejército europeo común a todos los miembros de la Unión. 

La defensa de las fronteras europeas, así como garantizar la seguridad de los ciudadanos de los países miembros debe ser una prioridad de la Unión. 

Tal y como ha demostrado la crisis de Afganistán, es de vital importancia que el Eurocuerpo actúe de manera independiente, desligándose en gran medida del apoyo de otras organizaciones especializadas en defensa como la OTAN, y del poder militar de otros países como EE. UU. De esta manera, son los propios países miembros los que aportarán las infraestructuras y el capital humano necesario, reduciendo la incertidumbre e incrementando la centralización de las decisiones y la rapidez de actuación. Para ello, se requiere un compromiso por parte de los países miembros en cuanto al aumento en el presupuesto de defensa, y en el desarrollo de la cultura de defensa. 

La voluntad de los países miembros y su capacidad de involucración son los aspectos claves en el fortalecimiento del Eurocuerpo.","Political refugees and terrorism are two of the main problems facing the European Union today. Given the current international landscape, the vulnerability of European borders requires greater attention and must therefore be defended. The events in Afghanistan and the possible rise of terrorism already in Afghanistan following the recent ISIS-K attack demonstrate the importance of forming a European army common to all members of the Union. The defence of European borders, as well as ensuring the security of the citizens of the member countries, must be a priority of the Union. As the Afghan crisis has shown, it is of vital importance that the Eurobody act independently, largely detaching itself from the support of other defence organisations such as NATO, and from the military power of other countries such as the US. U.S.A. In this way, it is the Member States themselves that will provide the necessary infrastructure and human capital, reducing uncertainty and increasing the centralisation of decisions and speed of action. This requires a commitment on the part of the member countries to the increase in the defence budget and to the development of the defence culture.

3.	Europa Progressio – a combination of the previous two; a well-organized differentiated integration.

Az „Európa népei közötti egyre szorosabb egység” jelentése az elmúlt évtizedekben megváltozott. Az unió alapító atyái még a kontinens népei közötti együttműködést, megbékélést értették alatta. Napjainkra a szlogen mögé bújva a birodalmi Európa hívei a nemzeti érdekeikért, a szuverenitásukért kiálló tagállamokat támadják. Céljuk egy olyan „egység” létrehozása, melyben feloldódik a nemzeti karakter.

Az integráció hívei lemondást követelnek a tagállamoktól. 

A tagállamok ellenállása érthető a „csakazértis” integrációval szemben. Támogatói főként az Euro bevezetését és a schengeni zóna kialakítását emlegetik, amikor a hatáskörátadás és az összeurópai megoldások mellett érvelnek. Azonban bebizonyosodott, hogy válsághelyzetben ezek nem működőképesek. 

Az integrációnak meg kell maradnia a minden tagállam számára előnyös együttműködés talaján. A vámunió, a munkaerő szabad áramlása, a valóban közös határvédelem mind olyan eredmények, amelyek mindenki számára előnyösek. Az egyes országok kulturális, politikai, vagy jogi-intézményi sajátosságait megváltoztatni kívánó törekvések azonban nem ilyenek. Utóbbiak ugyanis már nem egységesítést, hanem a nemzeti szuverenitást felszámoló, birodalmi jellegű Európa megteremtését jelentenék.

The meaning of ‘an ever closer union between the peoples of Europe’ has changed in recent decades. The founding fathers of the Union meant cooperation and reconciliation between the peoples of the continent. Today, hiding behind the slogan, adherents of Imperial Europe are attacking Member States that stand for their national interests and sovereignty. Their aim is to create a “unit” in which the national character is dissolved. Integration advocates demand renunciation from the Member States. The resistance of Member States to ‘only’ integration is understandable. Its supporters mainly refer to the introduction of the Euro and the creation of the Schengen zone when arguing for the transfer of competences and pan-European solutions. However, it has proved that they are not operational in a crisis situation. Integration must remain on the basis of cooperation to the benefit of all Member States. The customs union, the free movement of labour, a truly common border protection are all achievements that benefit everyone. However, attempts to change the cultural, political or legal-institutional specificities of individual countries are not such.

Diese Präsenz soll in allen 24 Amtssprachen der EU verfügbar, intuitiv bedienbar und unter einem prägnanten Namen wie rail.eu, eurorail.eu oder rail.europa.eu auffindbar sein.

Alle Eisenbahnverkehrsunternehmen in Europa sollen den Namen und das Logo dieser Präsenz an prominenter Stelle neben ihrem eigenen Logo verwenden.

Die Nutzung von Eurorail soll viele weitere Vorteile haben, wie die Nutzung von Lounges und geschützten Wartebereichen an zentralen Eisenbahnknoten.

Langfristig soll die Kommission ein Europaweites Taktsystem einführen. Strecken, die bisher nicht rentabel betrieben werden können, sollen von der Kommission ausgeschrieben werden. Die Züge sollen ein einheitliches Design, einheitliche Ausstattung und attraktive Namen erhalten.

Die Mehrwertsteuer auf ÖPNV-Leistungen soll abgeschafft werden.

Langfristig soll die EU die Überführung von Eisenbahninfrastruktur in eine zentrale europäische Agentur prüfen.","The European Union should aim at the introduction of a pan-European fast and night access network.

The use of eurozone is expected to have many other benefits, such as the use of lounges and protected waiting areas at central railway nodes.

Anche laddove l'Unione europea finanzi progetti intangibili, i beneficiari di tale attività dovrebbero sempre poter vedere visivamente che tale progetto è stato finanziato dall'UE (es. tramite spille, maglie, adesivi, fogli o mail che riportino la bandiera europea e la scritta poc'anzi citata).

Even where the European Union finances intangible projects, the beneficiaries of this activity should always be able to see visually that this project has been funded by the EU (e.g. through pins, meshes, stickers, sheets or e-mails bearing the European flag and the above-mentioned inscription).

Il documento parte dalla premessa che sarà indispensabile a termine consolidare i passi avanti compiuti dall'UE nel 2020 in una riforma dei Trattati in vigore. 

Tale riforma potrebbe essere realizzata tramite una revisione del trattato di Lisbona secondo la procedura dell'art. 48 TUE, ma potrebbe anche prendere la forma, in base al diritto internazionale, di un nuovo Trattato elaborato e ratificato da una sola maggioranza di Stati membri. 

In tal caso, occorrerà affidare un vero e proprio ruolo costituente al Parlamento europeo e includere nella riforma dell'Unione un testo costituzionale, una forma di governo europeo responsabile nei confronti di un Parlamento bicamerale, una nuova ripartizione delle competenze che attribuisca all'Unione federale un'autonomia strategica e una capacità fiscale autonoma e, infine, nuove disposizioni in materia di difesa dei valori fondamentali dell'Unione e dello Stato di diritto.

Such a reform could be achieved through a revision of the Treaty of Lisbon in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 48 TEU, but could also take the form, under international law, of a new treaty drawn up and ratified by a single majority of Member States. In such a case, it will be necessary to entrust a genuine constituent role to the European Parliament and to include in the reform of the Union a constitutional text, a form of European government accountable to a bicameral Parliament, a new division of competences giving the Federal Union strategic autonomy and autonomous fiscal capacity, and, finally, new provisions on the defence of the fundamental values of the Union and the rule of law.

Alle dyr fra hunde, katte, fugle, køer, grise, heste (listen er lang) lider ved menneskets brug af fyrværkeri! 

De høje brag og lysglimt forårsager angst i kroppen.

Brugen af fyrværkeri er meget skadeligt for dyrene og anvendelsen skal begrænses til et årligt brug på en halv time omkring årskiftet mellem den 31. december og 1. januar. På længere sigt bør brugen af fyrværkeri forbydes fuldt ud.

Som praktiserende dyrlæge gennem mange år oplever jeg hvert år, hvilke skader fyrværkeri påfører dyrene.

I mange tilfælde er det nødvendigt at give husdyrene stærkt beroligende medicin, således at de uden at blive psykisk invalideret kan komme gennem nytårsaften eller andre aftener i året, hvor fyrværkeri anvendes som f.eks. ved bryllupper og andre fester.

Dettte er ikke en mulighed for alle de dyr, der lever frit i naturen.

Dyrs skærpede hørelse, syn og lugtesans i forhold til os mennesker, gør oplevelsen af fyrværkeri meget skræmmende. Den angst, der forårsages, bæres med, når fyrværkeriet er slut.

Fyrværkeri kan derfor give dyrene skader for livet!

Dyrs evne til at ”cope” med nye ting, er begrænset. Pludselige skarpe lysglimt og høje lyde virker derfor ekstremt angstprovokerende hos dyrene, hvilket påfører dem unødig smerte.

Fremtidens Europa behandler dyr med værdighed og respekt.

All animals from dogs, cats, birds, cows, pigs, horses (the list is long) suffer from human use of fireworks! The high bursts and flashes cause anxiety in the body. The use of fireworks is very harmful to the animals and the use must be limited to an annual use of half an hour around the turn of the year between 31 December and 1 January. In the longer term, the use of fireworks should be completely banned. As a practicing veterinarian for many years, I experience every year what damage fireworks cause to the animals. In many cases, it is necessary to give livestock highly sedative medicines so that they can come through New Year’s Eve or other evenings of the year, without becoming mentally disabled, when fireworks are used, such as weddings and other parties. It is not an option for all the animals that live freely in the wild. Animal’s sharpened hearing, vision and sense of smell in relation to us humans, makes the experience of fireworks very frightening. The anxiety that is caused is borne by the end of the fireworks. Fireworks can therefore cause damage to the animals for life! Animals’ ability to “cope” with new things is limited. Sudden sharp flashes of light and loud sounds therefore have an extremely anxiety provocative effect in the animals, causing them unnecessary pain.

Currently ESA and EU work closely together, but ESA still has some inefficient vestiges of the early efforts. One example is the 'juste retour' or fair return principle which was supposed to make smaller member states more interested in contributing, but instead it has become a form of sanctioned state sector support for larger countries.

The EU's space programme is expanding further with the GOVSATCOM initiative and additional focus on space situational awareness - something currently part of ESA's portfolio. So a significant overlap and redundancy is bound to follow.

a vérplazma is ebbe a körbe tartozik. Kőkemény üzletről van szó, mert a vérplazma egyik alkotóelemének az ára az aranyéval vetekszik. Az immunglobulin, vagy human gamma-globulin patikai ára: 1 liter körülbelül 3,5 millió forint (a 100 százalékos tiszta hatóanyagra számolva).

Az immunglobulin a koronavírus kezelésében is fontos szerepet játszik, mert hatékonyan csökkenti a túlzott gyulladásos reakciókat. Egyetemisták azért fertőződnek meg szándékosan, hogy eladhassák a vérplazmájukat, ami sokkal értékesebb az aktív antitestek miatt.

Törvényesen sem pénzt sem más előnyöket nem ajánlhatnának fel a cégek a donoroknak. Mégis kijátsszák ezt egyszerűen, mert azt mondják, hogy ez nem vételár, hanem csak költségtérítés. Adnak mellé ajándékokat, ingyenes ételt, italt. És még a megelőző szűrővizsgálatokat is úgy állítják be, mintha azt csak a donor egészsége érdekében végeznék el.

Magyarországon már minden jelentősebb pénztermelő-ágazat a miniszterelnök kezében van. Strómanok beiktatásával intézi a kétes ügyleteit. Az Országos Vérellátó Központnál a miniszterelnök egyik legrégebbi harcostársának a felesége ad el külföldre évente több mint 40 000 liter vérplazmát.

A magánszférában a miniszterelnök veje ennek a területnek a strómanja. Országosan több mint 36 vérplazmagyűjtő-állomáson fogadják a plazmaadókat. Négynaponta 4-6 ezer forintért egy egységnyi vérplazmát vesznek le a donoroktól. Vérhiányt okoz a betegellátásban.","Trafficking in human organs is prohibited by law. Blood and plasma belong to this category. It’s a hard business, because the price of one of the components of the plasma is like gold. The price of immunoglobulin or human gamma-globulin: 1 litre is about 3.5 million forints (calculated as 100 percent pure active ingredient). Immunoglobulin also plays an important role in the treatment of coronavirus as it effectively reduces excessive inflammatory reactions. Students are deliberately infected to sell their plasma, which is more valuable because of active antibodies. Legally, no money or other benefits could be offered by companies to donors. Yet they're playing it out simply because they say it’s not a purchase price, it’s just a reimbursement. They give them gifts, free food, drinks. And even the preventive screening tests are set as if it were done only for the health of the donor. In Hungary, all major cash-generating sectors are already in the hands of the Prime Minister. He’s running his dubious business by instituting rogue men. At the National Blood Supply Center, the wife of one of the Prime Minister’s oldest combatants sells more than 40,000 litres of blood plasma abroad every year. In the private sphere, the Prime Minister’s son-in-law is the stróman of this area. Plasma transmitters are received nationwide at more than 36 plasma collection stations. For 4-6 thousand forints every four days, one unit of plasma is removed from donors.

8459,Per una sovranità europea. Le riforme necessarie.,"Il dibattito in corso sul futuro dell’Europa fa spesso riferimento alla necessità di creare una sovranità europea in quei campi in cui le politiche nazionali non riescono più ad essere efficaci. Poiché la sovranità è in ultima istanza legata al potere di agire, è necessario affrontare il tema di come rendere efficace il governo europeo per poter attuare quelle politiche interne ed estere che gli Europei devono condurre in modo unitario per proteggere i propri valori e i propri interessi. A questo scopo è necessaria una riforma dei Trattati che permetta di superare l’attuale subordinazione del funzionamento dell’UE alla volontà politica unanime degli Stati membri.

In questa ottica la riforma prioritaria è l’attribuzione di un potere fiscale all’UE, la quale deve essere dotata della capacità di raccogliere direttamente risorse e di spenderle nell’interesse generale. In questo senso deve essere attribuito al Parlamento europeo, in codecisione con il Consiglio, il potere di imporre direttamente imposte europee sui cittadini e sulle imprese dell’Unione europea.

Si tratta di una riforma che dovrà necessariamente accompagnarsi ad una revisione più ampia dei Trattati che affronti il rafforzamento delle competenze dell’UE e l’adeguamento in quelle materie dei meccanismi decisionali con la piena codecisione del Parlamento europeo e l’abolizione del voto all’unanimità nel Consiglio e dei veti nazionali.

Per approfondire leggi qui https://sway.office.com/G7hZEy9Cck14kVi3","The ongoing debate on the future of Europe often refers to the need to create European sovereignty in areas where national policies can no longer be effective. Given that sovereignty is ultimately linked to the power to act, it is necessary to address the question of how to make the European government effective in order to be able to implement the internal and foreign policies that Europeans must conduct in a unified manner in order to protect their values and interests. This requires a reform of the Treaties to overcome the current subordination of the functioning of the EU to the unanimous political will of the Member States. With this in mind, the priority reform is to give the EU fiscal power, which must have the capacity to raise resources directly and spend them in the general interest. In this sense, the European Parliament, in co-decision with the Council, should be given the power to impose directly European taxes on EU citizens and businesses. This reform will necessarily have to go hand in hand with a wider revision of the Treaties, addressing the strengthening of EU competences and the alignment of decision-making mechanisms in those areas with the full co-decision of the European Parliament and the abolition of unanimity voting in the Council and national vetoes.

Some measures may be taken to set up family allowances, crèches in companies and accept the idea of a man at home in our society.

104050,Nachhaltig in Europa reisen,"Unsere Idee: Es ist ein Ticket zu schaffen, welches es ermöglicht zu einem festgelegten Preis, kostengünstig europaweit vom Abfahrtsort bis zum Zielort mit nachhaltigen Fortbewegungsmitteln wie Bahn, Bus oder Fähre fahren zu können. Ein Kauf verschiedener Tickets von unterschiedlichen Anbietern ist dann nicht mehr nötig und die Angst des Reisenden eine bereits gekaufte terminierte Anschlussfahrt zu verpassen und damit das Recht auf Beförderung einzubüßen, würde verschwinden. Sicher und einfach europaweit reisen. 

ErasmusTicket: Europaweit treten jedes Jahr tausende Studierende ihr Auslandssemester an. Dieses ist bereits ein eher kostspieliges Unterfangen, da bleibt kaum Geld für eine nachhaltige Reisemöglichkeit übrig. Oft scheint der klimaschädliche Flug die kostengünstigste Anreise zu sein. Das ErasmusTicket soll Studierenden ermöglichen, ihre Reise einfach und kostengünstig nachhaltig zu gestalten. Bereits die Reise in ein anderes Land kann begeisternd und prägend sein. 

EuropaTicket: Das EuropaTicket könnte die Motivation von Urlauber*innen und Personen auf Geschäftsreisen, nachhaltig reisen zu wollen, erheblich erhöhen. Die Möglichkeit, während der Fahrt in Ruhe arbeiten zu können, wäre ein Pluspunkt für Unternehmen und diese könnten damit werben, auf Nachhaltigkeit und Umweltbewusstsein viel Wert zu legen. Ebenso könnte man ein Punktesystem  entwickeln, das dem Sammeln von Flugmeilen ähnelt. Damit würden nachhaltig Reisende belohnt und die Umwelt gewänne auf jeden Fall.","Our idea: It is possible to create a ticket that allows you to travel at a fixed price from the departure point to the destination in a cost-effective way, using sustainable means of transport such as rail, bus or ferry. A purchase of different tickets from different providers is then no longer necessary and the fear of the traveler to miss an already purchased scheduled connection trip and thereby lose the right to transport would disappear. Travel safely and easily across Europe. ErasmusTicket: Across Europe, thousands of students take up their semester abroad every year. This is already a rather costly undertaking, since there is hardly any money left for a sustainable travel opportunity. Often, the climate-damaging flight seems to be the most cost-effective journey. The ErasmusTicket is designed to enable students to make their journeys simple and cost-effectively sustainable. Already the journey to another country can be inspiring and influential. European ticket: The EuropaTicket could significantly increase the motivation of holidaymakers and people on business trips to want to travel sustainably. The possibility of being able to work in peace while driving would be a plus for companies and they could promote sustainability and environmental awareness. Similarly, one could develop a point system similar to the collection of flight miles. This would reward travellers sustainably and the environment would definitely be rewarded.",Sustainable travel in Europe,OtherIdeas,de,7,comment_102862,,"Super wichtiger Punkt.

254,European Passport for EU Citizens,"As a citizen of an EU member state, a person automatically receives EU citizenship as well. In most EU countries, this fact is displayed on the national passports by mentioning the European Union in one way or another. But the EU has transformed in recent history and, at the same time, had a significant impact on many of its citizens' sense of identity. In such an interconnected continent, many people feel like they are Europeans first. Why can this not be reflected on passports? A sense of belonging to the EU can complement an individual's nationality rather than threaten it. 

This idea calls for the implementation of an EU Passport for EU citizens. This passport should be centrally issued by the European Union and shall not replace national passports but rather complement them. The passport holder shall still be referred to as a national of an EU member state in the document. Still, the EU Passport shall primarily display the EU citizenship of the holder. EU officials are already issued with EU Passports which can be used as a blueprint for a passport rollout amongst EU citizens.

Let's give EU Citizenship the visibility it deserves.","As a citizen of an EU member state, a person automatically receives EU citizenship as well.

97816,3x30 Ideas from Integral Green Slovenia: 10. Integral Economy with Integration of Alternative Approaches to Support Holistic Implementation of SDGs,"For a new, integrative conceptual framework and process (Lessem & Schieffer, 2010), to support implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Slovenia, Europe, and globally, it is crucial that it offers alternative(s) to the mainstream non-sustainable economic paradigm, too. The Integral Worlds approach (3x30/02, 11/09/2021) regards economy as just one of the integral parts of society – one that needs to be fully “re-embedded” into society. Furthermore, this framework incorporates an inbuilt transformational rhythm, called the GENE (an acronym for Grounding, Emerging, Navigating, Effecting): we start the transformational process of a social system in “the south” (Nature and Community), thereby beginning with a conscious grounding in a given context and issue, before we then engage in its transformation. In addition to these conceptual elements, one of the most elaborated applications of Integral Worlds is in the economic sphere, integrating the wealth of innovative economic thinking and practice. 

According to INTEGRAL ECONOMICS, society needs to begin its process of integral economic development by securing “southern” nature-based economic self-sufficiency, before thereafter focusing on the other, “eastern”, “northern”, and “western”, economic functions. “Western” life-based living economy can be built up only through reconnecting finance and economic performance measurement to natural and human well-being.

Should the EU-wide military service also teach and train youngsters to kill people with weapons? (In the bad old days, they where called enemies, rather than people.)
I vaguely remember that you were supposed to learn to shoot 8 holes in the head of the target with 10 bullets from 150 meters with your personal weapon (an assault rifle with iron sights).
Three months may be enough for that, but then you should also learn to use group weapons (like mortars) to kill more enemies on one go. It takes more time and leadership skills.
